McLaurin. His mother, Laurie McLaurin (née Janin), was a former model from Mississippi, and his father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams, was a Ford Motor Company executive from Indiana. Williams had English, German, French, Welsh, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. Robin briefly studied political science before enrolling at Juilliard School to study theatre. After leaving Juilliard, he performed in nightclubs where he was discovered for the role of \"Mork, from Ork\", in an episode of Happy Days (1974). The episode, Happy Days: My Favorite Orkan (1978), led to his famous spin-off weekly TV series, Mork & Mindy (1978). He made his feature starring debut playing the title role in Popeye (1980), directed by Robert Altman. Williams' continuous comedies and wild comic talents involved a great deal of improvisation, following in the footsteps of his idol Jonathan Winters. Williams also proved to be an effective dramatic actor, receiving Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role in Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Dead Poets Society (1989), and The Fisher King (1991), before winning the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in Good Will Hunting (1997). During the 1990s, Williams became a beloved hero to children the world over for his roles in a string of hit family-oriented films, including Hook (1991), Les aventures de Zak et Crysta dans la forêt de FernGully (1992), Aladdin (1992), Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), Jumanji (1995), Flubber (1997), and Bicentennial Man (1999). He continued entertaining children and families into the 21st century with his work in Robots (2005), Happy Feet (2006), Night at the Museum (2006), Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009), Happy Feet 2 (2011), and Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014). Other more adult-oriented films for which Williams received acclaim include The World According to Garp (1982), Moscow on the Hudson (1984), Awakenings (1990), The Birdcage (1996), Insomnia (2002), One Hour Photo (2002), World's Greatest Dad (2009), and Boulevard (2014). On Monday, August 11th, 2014, Robin Williams was found dead at his home in Tiburon, California USA, the victim of an apparent suicide, according to the Marin County Sheriff's Department. A 911 call was received at 11:55 AM PDT, firefighters and paramedics arrived at his home at 12:00 PM PDT, and he was pronounced dead at 12:02 PM PDT.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYzMjc2Mjg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc1OTQwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245","name":"Robin Williams","idIMDB":"nm0000245","born":"July 21, 1951 in Chicago, Illinois, USA","died":"August 11, 2014 (age 63) in Tiburon, California, USA","starSign":"Cancer","starMeter":"76%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Absolutely Anything","year":" 2015","remarks":["Dennis the Dog (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1727770"},{"title":"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2692250"},{"title":"A Merry Friggin' Christmas","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0910885"},{"title":"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1294970"},{"title":"Boulevard","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2624412"},{"title":"The Crazy Ones","year":" 2013-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2710104"},{"title":"The Face of Love","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1839642"},{"title":"Lee Daniels' The Butler","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1327773"},{"title":"The Big Wedding","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1931435"},{"title":"Louie","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1492966"},{"title":"Wilfred","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1703925"},{"title":"Happy Feet 2","year":" 2011","remarks":["Ramon / Lovelace (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1402488"},{"title":"Saturday Night Live","year":" 1981-2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072562"},{"title":"Old Dogs","year":" 2009/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0976238"},{"title":"SpongeBob SquarePants","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0206512"},{"title":"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1078912"},{"title":"Shrink","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1247692"},{"title":"World's Greatest Dad","year":" 2009/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1262981"},{"title":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203259"},{"title":"American Idol","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0319931"},{"title":"August Rush","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0426931"},{"title":"License to Wed","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0762114"},{"title":"Night at the Museum","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0477347"},{"title":"Happy Feet","year":" 2006","remarks":["Ramon / Lovelace (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0366548"},{"title":"Man of the Year","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0483726"},{"title":"Everyone's Hero","year":" 2006","remarks":["Napoleon Cross (voice, uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0430779"},{"title":"RV","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0449089"},{"title":"The Night Listener","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0448075"},{"title":"The Big White","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0402850"},{"title":"Robots","year":" 2005","remarks":["Fender (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0358082"},{"title":"The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0318641"},{"title":"Noel","year":" 2004","remarks":["Charlie Boyd / The Priest (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0383534"},{"title":"House of D","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0372334"},{"title":"The Final Cut","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0364343"},{"title":"Freedom: A History of Us","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0361185"},{"title":"Life with Bonnie","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0320053"},{"title":"Insomnia","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0278504"},{"title":"Death to Smoochy","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0266452"},{"title":"One Hour Photo","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0265459"},{"title":"A.I.

Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the youngest of four children. His father, James Chester Reynolds, was a food wholesaler, and his mother, Tammy, worked as a retail-store saleswoman. Between 1991-93, Ryan appeared in Fifteen (1990), a Nickleodeon series taped in Florida with many other Canadian actors. After the series ended, he returned to Vancouver where he played in a series of forgettable television movies. He did small roles in Glenn Close's Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story (1995) and CBS's update of In Cold Blood (1996). However, his run of luck had led him to decide to quit acting. One night, he ran into fellow Vancouver actor and native Chris William Martin. Martin found Ryan rather despondent and told him to pack everything: they were going to head to Los Angeles, California. The two stayed in a cheap Los Angeles motel. On the first night of their stay, Reynolds' jeep was rolled downhill and stripped. For the next four months, Ryan drove it without doors. In 1997, he landed the role of Berg in Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998). Initially, the show was reviled by critics and seemed desperate for any type of ratings success. However, it was renewed for a second season but with a provision for a makeover by former Roseanne (1988) writer Kevin Abbott. The show became a minor success and has led to additional film roles for Ryan, most notably in the last-ever MGM film, a remake of The Amityville Horror (2005). Ryan was engaged to Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, another Nickelodeon veteran, between 2004-2006. He has been married to Blake Lively since September 9, 2012. They have two children. He was previous married to Scarlett Johansson.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI3ODk1MTMyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEyNTE2Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005351","name":"Ryan

He was selected by Screen International as one of their \"Stars of Tomorrow\" in 2013, which showcases the next generation of talent from the UK. Most recently, Skrein starred as the villain Ajax in Marvel's and Twentieth Century Fox's box office hit, Deadpool (2016), directed by Tim Miller and alongside Ryan Reynolds. The film shattered box office records, nearing $500 million worldwide. Deadpool (2016) chronicles the story of Marvel comic book character Deadpool (Reynolds), a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary who adopts an alter ego after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers. Skrein also recently starred in the Danish drama, The Model (2016), directed by Mads Matthiesen, who won the \"World Cinema - Dramatic\" award for his film, Teddy Bear at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. The Model (2016) follows an emerging fashion model attempting to enter the Parisian fashion scene who develops a deadly obsession for top fashion photographer Shane White (Skrein). Nordisk Film Distribution released the film in Denmark on February 11th. This year, Skrein will appear in the comedy crime film, Kill Your Friends (2015), directed by Owen Harris (Black Mirror) and alongside Nicholas Hoult and James Corden. Based on John Niven's 2008 novel, the film accounts the story of a 27-year-old A&R man working at the height of the Britpop music craze and going to extremes in order to find his next hit. Kill Your Friends (2015) screened at Cannes and was purchased by Well Go USA Entertainment, which will release the film on April 1st. Last year, Skrein starred in the action crime thriller reboot, Le Transporteur: Héritage (2015), directed by Camille Delamarre and produced by Luc Besson and Mark Gao (Lucy, Taken Trilogy). Skrein portrayed the lead role of Frank Martin, a former special-ops mercenary who now spends his life as a transporter of classified packages for questionable people on the other side of the law. In 2013, Skrein appeared in the critically-acclaimed and BAFTA and Critics Choice Television Award winning HBO series, Game of Thrones. Skrein portrayed the character Daario Naharis, originally a lieutenant in the \"Second Sons,\" who takes over the company after killing his superiors and aligns with Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke). In 2012, Skrein starred in Revolver Entertainment's critically-acclaimed drama Ill Manors, written and directed by Ben Drew. The film revolves around the lives of eight characters as they struggle to survive on the streets. It takes place over the course of seven days, each story blending into the others, painting a gritty picture of a world on the brink of destruction. Other film credits include The Sweeney, Tiger House, Piggy, Northmen: A Viking Saga, Sword of Vengeance and Goldfish. Other television credits include The Tunnel. Ed Skrein currently resides in London.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMzA1MTM4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ4NzU0OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4534098","name":"Ed Skrein","idIMDB":"nm4534098","born":"March 29, 1983 in Camden, London, England, UK","starSign":"Aries","starMeter":"53%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"A Patriot","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt8343330"},{"title":"Midway","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6924650"},{"title":"Maleficent 2","year":" 2020","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4777008"},{"title":"Born a King","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6718730"},{"title":"Alita: Battle Angel","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0437086"},{"title":"If Beale Street Could Talk","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt7125860"},{"title":"Black Swan Theory","year":" 2018","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3265590"},{"title":"Tau","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4357394"},{"title":"Patrick","year":" 2018/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6542108"},{"title":"In Darkness","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5164184"},{"title":"The Model","year":" 2016/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4074364"},{"title":"Deadpool","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1431045"},{"title":"Le Transporteur: Héritage","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2938956"},{"title":"Kill Your Friends","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2474958"},{"title":"Tiger House","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2911674"},{"title":"Sword of Vengeance","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3622332"},{"title":"Northmen - A Viking Saga","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2290553"},{"title":"Screaming Soul: Poverty","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt3579816"},{"title":"The Tunnel","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2711738"},{"title":"Game of Thrones","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0944947"},{"title":"The Sweeney","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0857190"},{"title":"Ill Manors","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1760967"},{"title":"Piggy","year":" 2012/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1951218"}]},{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Little River Run","year":" 2018","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt7964106"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Little River Run","year":" 2018","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt7964106"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Made in Hollywood","year":" 2015-2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0911896"},{"title":"Deadpool: From Comics to Screen... to Screen","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt5852644"},{"title":"2016 MTV Movie Awards","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt5556144"},{"title":"Rocketing from 0-60","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt5608492"},{"title":"The Transporter Refueled: Frank Martin - The Reluctant Hero","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt5602082"},{"title":"The Transporter Refueled: The Coeur Brisé - Les Femmes of Refueled","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt5602086"},{"title":"Last Call with Carson Daly","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0305056"},{"title":"Let's Go, DFW!","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4900764"},{"title":"Reel Junkie","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3234862"},{"title":"The Men in Blazers Show","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4380154"},{"title":"Weekend Ticket","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series short)"],"imdbid":"tt2787918"},{"title":"Game of Thrones: Season 2 - Invitation to the Set","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt2653340"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"ITV News at Ten","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0229912"}]}]},{"bio":"Michael Benyaer was born on May 25, 1970 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale's childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice. His first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in \"The Nerd\". A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (1986) caught Steven Spielberg's eye, leading to Bale's well-documented role in Empire of the Sun (1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor. Adjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in Kenneth Branagh's 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V (1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of Treasure Island (1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in Newsies (1992), Swing Kids (1993), Little Women (1994), The Portrait of a Lady (1996), The Secret Agent (1996), Metroland (1997), Velvet Goldmine (1998), All the Little Animals (1998), and A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique. Bale roared into the next decade with a lead role in American Psycho (2000), director Mary Harron's adaptation of the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for \"Entertainment Weekly\" crowned Bale one of the \"Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures\" of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the \"Most Creative People in Entertainment\", and \"Premiere\" lauded him as one of the \"Hottest Leading Men Under 30\". Bale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake Shaft (2000), Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001), the balmy Laurel Canyon (2002), and Reign of Fire (2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders. Two more cult films followed: Equilibrium (2002) and The Machinist (2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale's physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year. Bale's abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in Batman Begins (2005), the first chapter in Christopher Nolan's definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of Batman & Robin (1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing. Bale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman's phenomenal success: The New World (2005) and Harsh Times (2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006's Rescue Dawn (2006), Werner Herzog's feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary, Little Dieter Needs to Fly (1997). Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred in The Prestige (2006), the remake of 3:10 to Yuma (2007), and a reunion with director Todd Haynes in the experimental Bob Dylan biography, I'm Not There. (2007). Anticipation for The Dark Knight (2008) was spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing of Heath Ledger, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale's graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor. Bale's next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less Terminator Salvation (2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in Michael Mann's Public Enemies (2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be. For all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of The Fighter (2010)'s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation. Bale then turned to another auteur, Yimou Zhang, for the epic Sacrifices of War (2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government. Bale capped his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012); in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller Out of the Furnace (2013) with Crazy Heart (2009) writer/director Scott Cooper, and the drama-comedy American Hustle (2013), reuniting with David O. Russell. Bale will re-team with The New World (2005) director Terrence Malick for two upcoming projects: Knight of Cups (2015) and an as-yet-untitled drama. In his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation. He lives with his wife, Sibi Blazic, and their daughter, Emmeline.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzk4MjQ4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzExODQxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288","name":"Christian Bale","idIMDB":"nm0000288","born":"January 30, 1974 in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK","starSign":"Aquarius","starMeter":"66%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Ford v.

He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. His work comprised nineteen films, including 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), The Patriot (2000), A Knight's Tale (2001), Monster's Ball (2001), Ned Kelly (2003), The Brothers Grimm (2005), Lords of Dogtown (2005), Brokeback Mountain (2005), Casanova (2005), Candy (2006), I'm Not There. (2007), The Dark Knight (2008) and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director. Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. His ancestry was Scottish, English, Irish, and Sephardi Jewish. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break. His first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive cliché; an adolescent angst film about one boy's struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called Sweat (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was in Summer Bay (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in Paws (1997), a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri's brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played \"Oberon\". A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then came Two Hands (1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in Roar (1997) opposite then unknown Vera Farmiga. Then Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Two Hands (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Two Hands (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama The Patriot (2000). What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in Monster's Ball (2001), but his version of Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005). For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in in the film, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. His death occurred during editing of The Dark Knight (2008) and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). Posthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film I'm Not There.

In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan's life and persona. A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in 'The Dark Knight (2008). His untimely death cast a somber shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production. Ledger received more than thirty posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance as the Joker, the psychopathic clown prince of crime, in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he is the second actor to win an acting award posthumously after Peter Finch who won an Oscar

He left school at age 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England, he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised The Caine Mutiny (1954). In the years that followed, he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit \"The Long and the Short and the Tall\". Zulu (1964), the epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File (1965) and the title role in Alfie (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-1960s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Gambit (1966), Funeral in Berlin (1966), Play Dirty (1969), Battle of Britain (1969), Too Late the Hero (1970), The Last Valley (1971) and especially Get Carter (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command. However, there were some gems amongst the dross. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in The Eagle Has Landed (1976). Educating Rita (1983) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice (1998), The Cider House Rules (1999) (his second Oscar) and Last Orders (2001) have been widely acclaimed. Caine played Nigel Powers in the parody sequel Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), and Alfred Pennyworth in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. He appeared in several other of Nolan's films including The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014). He also appeared as a supporting character in Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men (2006) and Pixar's sequel Cars 2 (2011). As of 2015, films in which Caine has starred have grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide. He is ranked the ninth highest grossing box office star. Caine is one of several actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting every decade from five consecutive decades (the other being Laurence Olivier and Meryl Streep). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2000 Birthday Honours in recognition for his contributions to the cinema.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzIwNTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzE1MTUz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323","name":"Michael

Unlike Olivier, who preferred the stage to the screen, Brando concentrated his talents on movies after bidding the Broadway stage adieu in 1949, a decision for which he was severely criticized when his star began to dim in the 1960s and he was excoriated for squandering his talents. No actor ever exerted such a profound influence on succeeding generations of actors as did Brando. More than 50 years after he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie version of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979), all American actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was Brando. It was if the shadow of John Barrymore, the great American actor closest to Brando in terms of talent and stardom, dominated the acting field up until the 1970s. He did not, nor did any other actor so dominate the public's consciousness of what WAS an actor before or since Brando's 1951 on-screen portrayal of Stanley made him a cultural icon. Brando eclipsed the reputation of other great actors circa 1950, such as Paul Muni and Fredric March. Only the luster of Spencer Tracy's reputation hasn't dimmed when seen in the starlight thrown off by Brando. However, neither Tracy nor Olivier created an entire school of acting just by the force of his personality. Brando did. Marlon Brando, Jr. was born on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Marlon Brando, Sr., a calcium carbonate salesman, and his artistically inclined wife, the former Dorothy Julia Pennebaker. \"Bud\" Brando was one of three children. His ancestry included English, Irish, German, Dutch, French Huguenot, Welsh, and Scottish; his surname originated with a distant German immigrant ancestor named \"Brandau.\" His oldest sister Jocelyn Brando was also an actress, taking after their mother, who engaged in amateur theatricals and mentored a then-unknown Henry Fonda, another Nebraska native, in her role as director of the Omaha Community Playhouse. Frannie, Brando's other sibling, was a visual artist. Both Brando sisters contrived to leave the Midwest for New York City, Jocelyn to study acting and Frannie to study art. Marlon managed to escape the vocational doldrums forecast for him by his cold, distant father and his disapproving schoolteachers by striking out for The Big Apple in 1943, following Jocelyn into the acting profession. Acting was the only thing he was good at, for which he received praise, so he was determined to make it his career - a high-school dropout, he had nothing else to fall back on, having been rejected by the military due to a knee injury he incurred playing football at Shattuck Military Academy, Brando Sr.'s alma mater. The school booted Marlon out as incorrigible before graduation. Acting was a skill he honed as a child, the lonely son of alcoholic parents. With his father away on the road, and his mother frequently intoxicated to the point of stupefaction, the young Bud would play-act for her to draw her out of her stupor and to attract her attention and love. His mother was exceedingly neglectful, but he loved her, particularly for instilling in him a love of nature, a feeling which informed his character Paul in Last Tango in Paris (1972) (\"Last Tango in Paris\") when he is recalling his childhood for his young lover Jeanne. \"I don't have many good memories,\" Paul confesses, and neither did Brando of his childhood. Sometimes he had to go down to the town jail to pick up his mother after she had spent the night in the drunk tank and bring her home, events that traumatized the young boy but may have been the grain that irritated the oyster of his talent, producing the pearls of his performances. Anthony Quinn, his Oscar-winning co-star in Viva Zapata! (1952) told Brando's first wife Anna Kashfi, \"I admire Marlon's talent, but I don't envy the pain that created it.\" Brando enrolled in Erwin Piscator's Dramatic Workshop at New York's New School, and was mentored by Stella Adler, a member of a famous Yiddish Theatre acting family. Adler helped introduce to the New York stage the \"emotional memory\" technique of Russian theatrical actor, director and impresario Konstantin Stanislavski, whose motto was \"Think of your own experiences and use them truthfully.\" The results of this meeting between an actor and the teacher preparing him for a life in the theater would mark a watershed in American acting and culture. Brando made his debut on the boards of Broadway on October 19, 1944, in \"I Remember Mama,\" a great success. As a young Broadway actor, Brando was invited by talent scouts from several different studios to screen-test for them, but he turned them down because he would not let himself be bound by the then-standard seven-year contract. Brando would make his film debut quite some time later in Fred Zinnemann's The Men (1950) for producer Stanley Kramer. Playing a paraplegic soldier, Brando brought new levels of realism to the screen, expanding on the verisimilitude brought to movies by Group Theatre alumni John Garfield, the predecessor closest to him in the raw power he projected on-screen. Ironically, it was Garfield whom producer Irene Mayer Selznick had chosen to play the lead in a new Tennessee Williams play she was about to produce, but negotiations broke down when Garfield demanded an ownership stake in \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" Burt Lancaster was next approached, but couldn't get out of a prior film commitment. Then director Elia Kazan suggested Brando, whom he had directed to great effect in Maxwell Anderson's play \"Truckline Café,\" in which Brando co-starred with Karl Malden, who was to remain a close friend for the next 60 years. During the production of \"Truckline Café,\" Kazan had found that Brando's presence was so magnetic, he had to re-block the play to keep Marlon near other major characters' stage business, as the audience could not take its eyes off of him. For the scene where Brando's character re-enters the stage after killing his wife, Kazan placed him upstage-center, partially obscured by scenery, but where the audience could still see him as Karl Malden and others played out their scene within the café set. When he eventually entered the scene, crying, the effect was electric. A young Pauline Kael, arriving late to the play, had to avert her eyes when Brando made this entrance as she believed the young actor on stage was having a real-life conniption. She did not look back until her escort commented that the young man was a great actor. The problem with casting Brando as Stanley was that he was much younger than the character as written by Williams. However, after a meeting between Brando and Williams, the playwright eagerly agreed that Brando would make an ideal Stanley. Williams believed that by casting a younger actor, the Neanderthalish Kowalski would evolve from being a vicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be attributed to his youthful ignorance. Brando ultimately was dissatisfied with his performance, though, saying he never was able to bring out the humor of the character, which was ironic as his characterization often drew laughs from the audience at the expense of Jessica Tandy's Blanche Dubois. During the out-of-town tryouts, Kazan realized that Brando's magnetism was attracting attention and audience sympathy away from Blanche to Stanley, which was not what the playwright intended. The audience's sympathy should be solely with Blanche, but many spectators were identifying with Stanley. Kazan queried Williams on the matter, broaching the idea of a slight rewrite to tip the scales back to more of a balance between Stanley and Blanche, but Williams demurred, smitten as he was by Brando, just like the preview audiences. For his part, Brando believed that the audience sided with his Stanley because Jessica Tandy was too shrill. He thought Vivien Leigh, who played the part in the movie, was ideal, as she was not only a great beauty but she WAS Blanche Dubois, troubled as she was in her real life by mental illness and nymphomania. Brando's appearance as Stanley on stage and on screen revolutionized American acting by introducing \"The Method\" into American consciousness and culture. Method acting, rooted in Adler's study at the Moscow Art Theatre of Stanislavsky's theories that she subsequently introduced to the Group Theatre, was a more naturalistic style of performing, as it engendered a close identification of the actor with the character's emotions. Adler took first place among Brando's acting teachers, and socially she helped turn him from an unsophisticated Midwestern farm boy into a knowledgeable and cosmopolitan artist who one day would socialize with presidents. Brando didn't like the term \"The Method,\" which quickly became the prominent paradigm taught by such acting gurus as Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Brando denounced Strasberg in his autobiography \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\" (1994), saying that he was a talentless exploiter who claimed he had been Brando's mentor. The Actors Studio had been founded by Strasberg along with Kazan and Stella Adler's husband, Harold Clurman, all Group Theatre alumni, all political progressives deeply committed to the didactic function of the stage. Brando credits his knowledge of the craft to Adler and Kazan, while Kazan in his autobiography \"A Life\" claimed that Brando's genius thrived due to the thorough training Adler had given him. Adler's method emphasized that authenticity in acting is achieved by drawing on inner reality to expose deep emotional experience Interestingly, Elia Kazan believed that Brando had ruined two generations of actors, his contemporaries and those who came after him, all wanting to emulate the great Brando by employing The Method. Kazan felt that Brando was never a Method actor, that he had been highly trained by Adler and did not rely on gut instincts for his performances, as was commonly believed. Many a young actor, mistaken about the true roots of Brando's genius, thought that all it took was to find a character's motivation, empathize with the character through sense and memory association, and regurgitate it all on stage to become the character. That's not how the superbly trained Brando did it; he could, for example, play accents, whereas your average American Method actor could not. There was a method to Brando's art, Kazan felt, but it was not The Method. After A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), for which he received the first of his eight Academy Award nominations, Brando appeared in a string of Academy Award-nominated performances - in Viva Zapata! (1952), Julius Caesar (1953) and the summit of his early career, Kazan's On the Waterfront (1954). For his \"Waterfront\" portrayal of meat-headed longshoreman Terry Malloy, the washed-up pug who \"coulda been a contender,\" Brando won his first Oscar. Along with his iconic performance as the rebel-without-a-cause Johnny in The Wild One (1953) (\"What are you rebelling against?\" Johnny is asked. \"What have ya got?\" is his reply), the first wave of his career was, according to Jon Voight, unprecedented in its audacious presentation of such a wide range of great acting. Director John Huston said his performance of Marc Antony was like seeing the door of a furnace opened in a dark room, and co-star John Gielgud, the premier Shakespearean actor of the 20th century, invited Brando to join his repertory company. It was this period of 1951-54 that revolutionized American acting, spawning such imitators as James Dean - who modeled his acting and even his lifestyle on his hero Brando - the young Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. After Brando, every up-and-coming star with true acting talent and a brooding, alienated quality would be hailed as the \"New Brando,\" such as Warren Beatty in Kazan's Splendor in the Grass (1961). \"We are all Brando's children,\" Jack Nicholson pointed out in 1972. \"He gave us our freedom.\" He was truly \"The Godfather\" of American acting - and he was just 30 years old. Though he had a couple of failures, like Désirée (1954) and The Teahouse of the August Moon (1956), he was clearly miscast in them and hadn't sought out the parts so largely escaped blame. In the second period of his career, 1955-62, Brando managed to uniquely establish himself as a great actor who also was a Top 10 movie star, although that star began to dim after the box-office high point of his early career, Sayonara (1957) (for which he received his fifth Best Actor Oscar nomination). Brando tried his hand at directing a film, the well-reviewed One-Eyed Jacks (1961) that he made for his own production company, Pennebaker Productions (after his mother's maiden name). Stanley Kubrick had been hired to direct the film, but after months of script rewrites in which Brando participated, Kubrick and Brando had a falling out and Kubrick was sacked. According to his widow Christiane Kubrick, Stanley believed that Brando had wanted to direct the film himself all along. Tales proliferated about the profligacy of Brando the director, burning up a million and a half feet of expensive VistaVision film at 50 cents a foot, fully ten times the normal amount of raw stock expended during production of an equivalent motion picture. Brando took so long editing the film that he was never able to present the studio with a cut. Paramount took it away from him and tacked on a re-shot ending that Brando was dissatisfied with, as it made the Oedipal figure of Dad Longworth into a villain. In any normal film Dad would have been the heavy, but Brando believed that no one was innately evil, that it was a matter of an individual responding to, and being molded by, one's environment. It was not a black-and-white world, Brando felt, but a gray world in which once-decent people could do horrible things. This attitude explains his sympathetic portrayal of Nazi officer Christian Diestl in the film he made before shooting One-Eyed Jacks (1961), Edward Dmytryk's filming of Irwin Shaw's novel The Young Lions (1958). Shaw denounced Brando's performance, but audiences obviously disagreed, as the film was a major hit. It would be the last hit movie Brando would have for more than a decade. One-Eyed Jacks (1961) generated respectable numbers at the box office, but the production costs were exorbitant - a then-staggering $6 million - which made it run a deficit. A film essentially is \"made\" in the editing room, and Brando found cutting to be a terribly boring process, which was why the studio eventually took the film away from him. Despite his proved talent in handling actors and a large production, Brando never again directed another film, though he would claim that all actors essentially direct themselves during the shooting of a picture. Between the production and release of One-Eyed Jacks (1961), Brando appeared in Sidney Lumet's film version of Tennessee Williams' play \"Orpheus Descending,\" The Fugitive Kind (1960) which teamed him with fellow Oscar winners Anna Magnani and Joanne Woodward. Following in Elizabeth Taylor's trailblazing footsteps, Brando became the second performer to receive a $1-million salary for a motion picture, so high were the expectations for this re-teaming of Kowalski and his creator (in 1961 critic Hollis Alpert had published a book \"Brando and the Shadow of Stanley Kowalski\"). Critics and audiences waiting for another incendiary display from Brando in a Williams work were disappointed when the renamed The Fugitive Kind (1960) finally released. Though Tennessee was hot, with movie versions of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) and Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) burning up the box office and receiving kudos from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, The Fugitive Kind (1960) was a failure. This was followed by the so-so box-office reception of One-Eyed Jacks (1961) in 1961 and then by a failure of a more monumental kind: Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), a remake of the famed 1935 film. Brando signed on to Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) after turning down the lead in the David Lean classic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) because he didn't want to spend a year in the desert riding around on a camel. He received another $1-million salary, plus $200,000 in overages as the shoot went overtime and over budget. During principal photography, highly respected director Carol Reed (an eventual Academy Award winner) was fired, and his replacement, two-time Oscar winner Lewis Milestone, was shunted aside by Brando as Marlon basically took over the direction of the film himself. The long shoot became so notorious that President John F. Kennedy asked director Billy Wilder at a cocktail party not \"when\" but \"if\" the \"Bounty\" shoot would ever be over. The MGM remake of one of its classic Golden Age films garnered a Best Picture Oscar nomination and was one of the top grossing films of 1962, yet failed to go into the black due to its Brobdingnagian budget estimated at $20 million, which is equivalent to $120 million when adjusted for inflation. Brando and Taylor, whose Cleopatra (1963) nearly bankrupted 20th Century-Fox due to its huge cost overruns (its final budget was more than twice that of Brando's Mutiny on the Bounty (1962)), were pilloried by the show business press for being the epitome of the pampered, self-indulgent stars who were ruining the industry. Seeking scapegoats, the Hollywood press conveniently ignored the financial pressures on the studios. The studios had been hurt by television and by the antitrust-mandated divestiture of their movie theater chains, causing a large outflow of production to Italy and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s in order to lower costs. The studio bosses, seeking to replicate such blockbuster hits as the remakes of The Ten Commandments (1956) and Ben-Hur (1959), were the real culprits behind the losses generated by large-budgeted films that found it impossible to recoup their costs despite long lines at the box office. While Elizabeth Taylor, receiving the unwanted gift of reams of publicity from her adulterous romance with Cleopatra (1963) co-star Richard Burton, remained hot until the tanking of her own Tennessee Williams-renamed debacle Boom! (1968), Brando from 1963 until the end of the decade appeared in one box-office failure after another as he worked out a contract he had signed with Universal Pictures. The industry had grown tired of Brando and his idiosyncrasies, though he continued to be offered prestige projects up through 1968. Some of the films Brando made in the 1960s were noble failures, such as The Ugly American (1963), The Appaloosa (1966) and Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967). For every \"Reflections,\" though, there seemed to be two or three outright debacles, such as Bedtime Story (1964), Morituri (1965), The Chase (1966), A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), Candy (1968), The Night of the Following Day (1969). By the time Brando began making the anti-colonialist picture Burn! (1969) in Colombia with Gillo Pontecorvo in the director's chair, he was box-office poison, despite having worked in the previous five years with such top directors as Arthur Penn, John Huston and the legendary Charles Chaplin, and with such top-drawer co-stars as David Niven, Yul Brynner, Sophia Loren and Taylor. The rap on Brando in the 1960s was that a great talent had ruined his potential to be America's answer to Laurence Olivier, as his friend William Redfield limned the dilemma in his book \"Letters from an Actor\" (1967), a memoir about Redfield's appearance in Burton's 1964 theatrical production of \"Hamlet.\" By failing to go back on stage and recharge his artistic batteries, something British actors such as Burton were not afraid to do, Brando had stifled his great talent, by refusing to tackle the classical repertoire and contemporary drama. Actors and critics had yearned for an American response to the high-acting style of the Brits, and while Method actors such as Rod Steiger tried to create an American style, they were hampered in their quest, as their king was lost in a wasteland of Hollywood movies that were beneath his talent. Many of his early supporters now turned on him, claiming he was a crass sellout. Despite evidence in such films as The Appaloosa (1966) and Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967) that Brando was in fact doing some of the best acting of his life, critics, perhaps with an eye on the box office, slammed him for failing to live up to, and nurture, his great gift. Brando's political activism, starting in the early 1960s with his championing of Native Americans' rights, followed by his participation in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's March on Washington in 1963, and followed by his appearance at a Black Panther rally in 1968, did not win him many admirers in the establishment. In fact, there was a de facto embargo on Brando films in the recently segregated (officially, at least) southeastern US in the 1960s. Southern exhibitors simply would not book his films, and producers took notice. After 1968, Brando would not work for three years. Pauline Kael wrote of Brando that he was Fortune's fool. She drew a parallel with the latter career of John Barrymore, a similarly gifted thespian with talents as prodigious, who seemingly threw them away. Brando, like the late-career Barrymore, had become a great ham, evidenced by his turn as the faux Indian guru in the egregious Candy (1968), seemingly because the material was so beneath his talent. Most observers of Brando in the 1960s believed that he needed to be reunited with his old mentor Elia Kazan, a relationship that had soured due to Kazan's friendly testimony naming names before the notorious House un-American Activities Committee. Perhaps Brando believed this, too, as he originally accepted an offer to appear as the star of Kazan's film adaptation of his own novel, The Arrangement (1969). However, after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Brando backed out of the film, telling Kazan that he could not appear in a Hollywood film after this tragedy. Also reportedly turning down a role opposite box-office king Paul Newman in a surefire script, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), Brando decided to make Burn! (1969) with Pontecorvo. The film, a searing indictment of racism and colonialism, flopped at the box office but won the esteem of progressive critics and cultural arbiters such as Howard Zinn. He subsequently appeared in the British film The Nightcomers (1971), a prequel to \"Turn of the Screw\" and another critical and box office failure. Kazan, after a life in film and the theater, said that, aside from Orson Welles, whose greatness lay in film making, he only met one actor who was a genius: Brando. Richard Burton, an intellectual with a keen eye for observation if not for his own film projects, said that he found Brando to be very bright, unlike the public perception of him as a Terry Malloy-type character that he himself inadvertently promoted through his boorish behavior. Brando's problem, Burton felt, was that he was unique, and that he had gotten too much fame too soon at too early an age. Cut off from being nurtured by normal contact with society, fame had distorted Brando's personality and his ability to cope with the world, as he had not had time to grow up outside the limelight. Truman Capote, who eviscerated Brando in print in the mid-'50s and had as much to do with the public perception of the dyslexic Brando as a dumbbell, always said that the best actors were ignorant, and that an intelligent person could not be a good actor. However, Brando was highly intelligent, and possessed of a rare genius in a then-deprecated art, acting. The problem that an intelligent performer has in movies is that it is the director, and not the actor, who has the power in his chosen field. Greatness in the other arts is defined by how much control the artist is able to exert over his chosen medium, but in movie acting, the medium is controlled by a person outside the individual artist. It is an axiom of the cinema that a performance, as is a film, is \"created\" in the cutting room, thus further removing the actor from control over his art. Brando had tried his hand at directing, in controlling the whole artistic enterprise, but he could not abide the cutting room, where a film and the film's performances are made. This lack of control over his art was the root of Brando's discontent with acting, with movies, and, eventually, with the whole wide world that invested so much cachet in movie actors, as long as \"they\" were at the top of the box-office charts. Hollywood was a matter of \"they\" and not the work, and Brando became disgusted. Charlton Heston, who participated in Martin Luther King's 1963 March on Washington with Brando, believes that Marlon was the great actor of his generation. However, noting a story that Brando had once refused a role in the early 1960s with the excuse \"How can I act when people are starving in India?,\" Heston believes that it was this attitude, the inability to separate one's idealism from one's work, that prevented Brando from reaching his potential. As Rod Steiger once said, Brando had it all, great stardom and a great talent. He could have taken his audience on a trip to the stars, but he simply would not. Steiger, one of Brando's children even though a contemporary, could not understand it. When James Mason' was asked in 1971 who was the best American actor, he had replied that since Brando had let his career go belly-up, it had to be George C. Scott, by default. Paramount thought that only Laurence Olivier would suffice, but Lord Olivier was ill. The young director believed there was only one actor who could play godfather to the group of Young Turk actors he had assembled for his film, The Godfather of method acting himself - Marlon Brando. Francis Ford Coppola won the fight for Brando, Brando won - and refused - his second Oscar, and Paramount won a pot of gold by producing the then top-grossing film of all-time, The Godfather (1972), a gangster movie most critics now judge one of the greatest American films of all time. Brando followed his iconic portrayal of Don Corleone with his Oscar-nominated turn in the high-grossing and highly scandalous Last Tango in Paris (1972) (\"Last Tango in Paris\"), the first film dealing explicitly with sexuality in which an actor of Brando's stature had participated. He was now again a top ten box office star and once again heralded as the greatest actor of his generation, an unprecedented comeback that put him on the cover of \"Time\" magazine and would make him the highest-paid actor in the history of motion pictures by the end of the decade. Little did the world know that Brando, who had struggled through many projects in good faith during the 1960s, delivering some of his best acting, only to be excoriated and ignored as the films did not do well at the box office, essentially was through with the movies. After reaching the summit of his career, a rarefied atmosphere never reached before or since by any actor, Brando essentially walked away. He would give no more of himself after giving everything as he had done in Last Tango in Paris (1972),\" a performance that embarrassed him, according to his autobiography. Brando had come as close to any actor to being the \"auteur,\" or author, of a film, as the English-language scenes of \"Tango\" were created by encouraging Brando to improvise. The improvisations were written down and turned into a shooting script, and the scripted improvisations were shot the next day. Pauline Kael, the Brando of movie critics in that she was the most influential arbiter of cinematic quality of her generation and spawned a whole legion of Kael wannabes, said Brando's performance in Last Tango in Paris (1972) had revolutionized the art of film. Brando, who had to act to gain his mother's attention; Brando, who believed acting at best was nothing special as everyone in the world engaged in it every day of their lives to get what they wanted from other people; Brando, who believed acting at its worst was a childish charade and that movie stardom was a whorish fraud, would have agreed with Sam Peckinpah's summation of Pauline Kael: \"Pauline's a brilliant critic but sometimes she's just cracking walnuts with her ass.\" He probably would have done so in a simulacrum of those words, too. After another three-year hiatus, Brando took on just one more major role for the next 20 years, as the bounty hunter after Jack Nicholson in Arthur Penn's The Missouri Breaks (1976), a western that succeeded neither with the critics or at the box office. Following The Godfather and Tango, Brando's performance was disappointing for some reviewers, who accused him of giving an erratic and inconsistent performance. In 1977, Brando made a rare appearance on television in the miniseries Roots: The Next Generations (1979), portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance. In 1978, he narrated the English version of Raoni (1978), a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil. Later in his career, Brando concentrated on extracting the maximum amount of capital for the least amount of work from producers, as when he got the Salkind brothers to pony up a then-record $3.7 million against 10% of the gross for 13 days work on Superman (1978). Factoring in inflation, the straight salary for \"Superman\" equals or exceeds the new record of $1 million a day Harrison Ford set with K-19: The Widowmaker (2002). He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie's sequel, Superman II, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage. Before cashing his first paycheck for Superman (1978), Brando had picked up $2 million for his extended cameo in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979) in a role, that of Col. Kurtz, that he authored on-camera through improvisation while Coppola shot take after take. It was Brando's last bravura star performance. He co-starred with George C. Scott and John Gielgud in La formule (1980), but the film was another critical and financial failure. Years later though, he did receive an eighth and final Oscar nomination for his supporting role in A Dry White Season (1989) after coming out of a near-decade-long retirement. Contrary to those who claimed he now only was in it for the money, Brando donated his entire seven-figure salary to an anti-apartheid charity. He then did an amusing performance in the comedy The Freshman (1990), winning rave reviews. He portrayed Tomas de Torquemada in the historical drama 1492: Christophe Colomb (1992), but his performance was denounced and the film was another box office failure. He made another comeback in the Johnny Depp romantic drama Don Juan DeMarco (1994), which co-starred Faye Dunaway as his wife. He then appeared in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), co-starring Val Kilmer, who he didn't get along with. The filming was an unpleasant experience for Brando, as well as another critical and box office failure. Brando had first attracted media attention at the age of 24, when \"Life\" magazine ran a photo of himself and his sister Jocelyn, who were both then appearing on Broadway. The curiosity continued, and snowballed. Playing the paraplegic soldier of The Men (1950), Brando had gone to live at a Veterans Administration hospital with actual disabled veterans, and confined himself to a wheelchair for weeks.

Alfredo James Pacino was born on April 25, 1940 in Manhattan, New York City, to an Italian-American family. His parents, Rose (Gerardi) and Sal Pacino, divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents' house. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies, one of his favorite activities. Bored and unmotivated in school, the young Al Pacino found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting on the stage, he went through a lengthy period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors. After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally succeeded with Israel Horovitz's \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\", winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for \"Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?\". His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in The Panic in Needle Park (1971) after his film debut in Me, Natalie (1969). What came next would change his life forever. The role of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O'Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of others either wanted it or were mentioned for it, but director Francis Ford Coppola had his heart set on the unknown Italian Pacino for the role, although pretty much everyone else--from the studio to the producers to some of the cast members--did not want him. Though Coppola won out through slick persuasion, Pacino was in constant fear of being fired during the hellish shoot. Much to his (and Coppola's) relief, the film was a monster hit that did wonders for everyone's career, including Pacino's, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Serpico (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Dog Day Afternoon (1975). He opened eyes around the film world for his brave choice of roles, and he was nominated three consecutive years for the \"Best Actor\" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Bobby Deerfield (1977), but regained his stride with ...and justice for all. (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced such critical and commercial flops as Cruising - La Chasse (1980) and Author! Author! (1982). Pacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film Scarface (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino became terribly sick with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script also further derailed a project that seemed doomed from the start anyway. The Revolutionary War film is considered one of the worst films ever, not to mention one of the worst of his career, resulted in his first truly awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino has done much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking Sea of Love (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice. Returning to the Corleones, Pacino made The Godfather: Part III (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He went into romantic mode for Frankie and Johnny (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Scent of a Woman (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic. The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. Carlito's Way (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Heat (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro, although they only had a few scenes together. He returned to the director's chair for the highly acclaimed and quirky Shakespeare adaptation Looking for Richard (1996). City Hall (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and The Devil's Advocate (1997) all came out in this period. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave two commanding performances in The Insider (1999) and Any Given Sunday (1999). In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Ocean's Thirteen (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Angels in America (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie You Don't Know Jack (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie. In his personal life, Pacino is one of Hollywood's most enduring and notorious bachelors, having never been married. He has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a new set of twins with longtime girlfriend Beverly D'Angelo. His romantic history includes a long-time romance with \"Godfather\" co-star Diane Keaton. With his intense and gritty performances, Pacino was an original in the acting profession. His Method approach would become the process of many actors throughout time, and his unbeatable number of classic roles has already made him a legend among film buffs and all aspiring actors and directors. His commitment to acting as a profession and his constant screen dominance has established him as one of the movies' true legends. Pacino has never abandoned his love for the theater, and Shakespeare in particular, having directed the Shakespeare adaptation Looking for Richard (1996) and played Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (2004).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMzg1ODAyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjAxODQ1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199","name":"Al Pacino","nicknames":["Sonny"],"idIMDB":"nm0000199","born":"April 25, 1940 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","starSign":"Taurus","starMeter":"83%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt7131622"},{"title":"The Irishman","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1302006"},{"title":"Paterno","year":" 2018","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2388986"},{"title":"Hangman","year":" 2017/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3011960"},{"title":"The Pirates of Somalia","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5126922"},{"title":"Misconduct","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3658772"},{"title":"Danny Collins","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1772288"},{"title":"Manglehorn","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2893490"},{"title":"The Humbling","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1568343"},{"title":"Salomé","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3112900"},{"title":"Phil Spector","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1745862"},{"title":"We Are Not Animals","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1859476"},{"title":"Stand Up Guys","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1389096"},{"title":"Jack and Jill","year":" 2011/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0810913"},{"title":"The Son of No One","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1535612"},{"title":"You Don't Know Jack","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1132623"},{"title":"Righteous Kill","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1034331"},{"title":"Ocean's Thirteen","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0496806"},{"title":"88 Minutes","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0411061"},{"title":"Two for the Money","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0417217"},{"title":"The Merchant of Venice","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0379889"},{"title":"Angels in America","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0318997"},{"title":"Gigli","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0299930"},{"title":"The Recruit","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0292506"},{"title":"People I Know","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0274711"},{"title":"S1m0ne","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0258153"},{"title":"Insomnia","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0278504"},{"title":"Chinese Coffee","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118852"},{"title":"Any Given Sunday","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0146838"},{"title":"The Insider","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0140352"},{"title":"The Devil's Advocate","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118971"},{"title":"Donnie Brasco","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119008"},{"title":"City Hall","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0115907"},{"title":"Heat","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0113277"},{"title":"Two Bits","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0114753"},{"title":"Carlito's Way","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0106519"},{"title":"Scent of a Woman","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0105323"},{"title":"Glengarry Glen Ross","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104348"},{"title":"Frankie and Johnny","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0101912"},{"title":"The Godfather: Part III","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0099674"},{"title":"Dick Tracy","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0099422"},{"title":"The Local Stigmatic","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097769"},{"title":"Sea of Love","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0098273"},{"title":"Revolution","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0089913"},{"title":"Scarface","year":" 1983","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0086250"},{"title":"Author!

He was born in the Bronx, to Sophie (Falkenstein) and Arthur Caan, Jewish immigrants from Germany. His father was a meat dealer and butcher. The athletically gifted Caan played football at Michigan State University while studying economics, holds a black belt in karate and for several years was even a regular on the rodeo circuit, where he was nicknamed \"The Jewish Cowboy\". However, while studying at Hofstra University, he became intrigued by acting and was interviewed and accepted at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. He then won a scholarship to study under acting coach Wynn Handman and began to appear in several off-Broadway productions, including \"I Roam\" and \"Mandingo\". He made his screen debut as a sailor in Irma la Douce (1963) and began to impress audiences with his work in Red Line 7000 (1965) and the western El Dorado (1967) alongside John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. Further work followed in Journey to Shiloh (1968) and in the sensitive The Rain People (1969). However, audiences were moved to tears as he put in a heart-rending performance as cancer-stricken Chicago Bears running back Brian Piccolo in the highly rated made-for-TV film Brian's Song (1971). With these strong performances under his belt, Francis Ford Coppola then cast him as hot-tempered gangster Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone in the Mafia epic The Godfather (1972). The film was an enormous success, Caan scored a Best Supporting Actor nomination and, in the years since, the role has proven to be the one most fondly remembered by his legion of fans. He reprised the role for several flashback scenes in the sequel The Godfather: Part II (1974) and then moved on to several very diverse projects. These included a cop-buddy crime partnership with Alan Arkin in the uneven Freebie and the Bean (1974), a superb performance as a man playing for his life in The Gambler (1974) alongside Lauren Hutton, and pairing with Barbra Streisand in Funny Lady (1975). Two further strong lead roles came up for him in 1975, first as futuristic sports star \"Jonathon E\" questioning the moral fiber of a sterile society in Rollerball (1975) and teaming up with Robert Duvall in the Sam Peckinpah spy thriller The Killer Elite (1975). Unfortunately, Caan's rising star sputtered badly at this stage of his career, and several film projects failed to find fire with either critics or audiences. These included such failures as the hokey Harry and Walter Go to New York (1976), the quasi-western Comes a Horseman (1978) and the saccharine Chapter Two (1979). However, he did score again with the stylish Michael Mann-directed heist movie Thief (1981). He followed this with a supernatural romantic comedy titled Kiss Me Goodbye (1982) and then, due to personal conflicts, dropped out of the spotlight for several years before returning with a stellar performance under old friend Francis Ford Coppola in the moving Gardens of Stone (1987). Caan appeared back in favor with fans and critics alike and raised his visibility with the sci-fi hit Alien Nation (1988) and Dick Tracy (1990), then surprised everyone by playing a meek romance novelist held captive after a car accident by a deranged fan in the dynamic Misery (1990). The 1990s were kind to him and he notched up roles as a band leader in For the Boys (1991), another gangster in Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), appeared in the indie hit Bottle Rocket (1996) and pursued Arnold Schwarzenegger in Eraser (1996). The demand on Caan's talents seems to have increased steadily over the past few years as he is making himself known to a new generation of fans. Recent hot onscreen roles have included The Yards (2000), City of Ghosts (2002) and Dogville (2003). In addition, he finds himself at the helm of the hit TV series Las Vegas (2003) as casino security chief \"Big Ed\" Deline. An actor of undeniably manly appeal, James Caan continues to surprise and delight audiences with his invigorating performances.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NjkyNDQ3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY5NTQ0Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001001","name":"James

He was originally a construction company manager, then he gained work with the New Yiddish Theatre, before breaking into film near his thirtieth birthday. However in 1970, in only his fourth film, Castellano received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance in Lovers and Other Strangers (1970) and came to the attention of casting agents for The Godfather (1972). After his strong showing as a tough hoodlum in The Godfather (1972), he became somewhat typecast as a screen criminal and appeared in further crime films including Honor Thy Father (1973) and Gangster Wars (1981).

Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history. Tom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted to become a Priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in Endless Love (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences. With handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top grossing films of the 1980s including Top Gun (1986); The Color of Money (1986), Rain Man (1988) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). By the 1990s he was one of the highest paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Jerry Maguire (1996) for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. Tom Cruise's biggest franchise , Mission Impossible has also earned a total of 3 billion dollars worldwide. Tom cruise has also shown lots of interest in producing with his biggest producer credits being the Mission impossible franchise. In 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church Of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress Nicole Kidman until 2001. Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has indeed come a long way from the lonely wanderings of his youth to become one of the biggest movie stars ever.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MjM3NTU5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTMyMjAyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129","name":"Tom

She lived with her mother, brothers, and sister on a farm not far from Saint-Tropez in Provence (southern France), because her father, singer and poet Guy Béart, did not want his children to be affected by the glamour world of Paris. When Emmanuelle was thirteen, she saw Romy Schneider in the movie Mado (1976). From that time on, she wanted to be an actress. In Emmanuelle's teens, her parents sent her to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for four years, so she could learn English. There, she was engaged for a Robert Altman movie that was never made. After returning to France, she took drama classes and got her first TV role, in Raison perdue (1984). David Hamilton, the photographer/director, was impressed by her beauty and gave her a role in Premiers désirs (1983). She met her spouse-to-be, Daniel Auteuil, while making L'amour en douce (1985). The film that made her famous in France was Manon of the Spring (1986), in which she played the role of a blonde shepherd dancing nude in the fields. Director Tom McLoughlin chose her out of 5,000 candidates for her first Hollywood picture, Date with an Angel (1987). Emmanuelle is a very sensitive and a perfectionist. For the part of Camille in the film Un Coeur en Hiver (1992), she took violin lessons for a whole year. Her biggest success was as a nude model in the art film La belle noiseuse (1991), which starred Michel Piccoli and was directed by Jacques Rivette.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDQ4ODU2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjI0ODgz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000322","name":"Emmanuelle

DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Growing Pains (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan. Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (née Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs. DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and The New Lassie (1989), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Critters 3 (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While Critters 3 (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Growing Pains (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on Growing Pains (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), a young gunslinger in Mort ou vif (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in The Basketball Diaries (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Titanic (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, Titanic (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Titanic (1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in L'homme au masque de fer (1998) and the low-budget The Beach (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period. In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as The Departed (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors. In 2012, he played a mustache-twirling villain in Django Unchained (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in Gatsby le magnifique (2013) and Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).

Joseph was raised in a Jewish family with his late older brother, Dan Gordon-Levitt, who passed away in October 2010. His parents worked for the Pacifica Radio station KPFK-FM and his maternal grandfather, Michael Gordon, had been a well-known movie director. After working for several years as a child actor, Joseph became better known for starring on the hit television series 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996), for which he earned two Hollywood Reporter Young Star Awards. In addition, the show earned three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Outstanding Peformance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Prior to his success on television, Joseph had already worked steadily in feature films, debuting in the Robert Redford film A River Runs Through It (1992). He won a Young Artist Award for the latter film. During the 1990s, he also co-starred in the films Angels in the Outfield (1994), The Juror (1996), Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), and 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). Following his work on 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996), Joseph took time off from acting to attend Columbia University. In the early 2000s, he broke from the mold of his television and film comedy supporting roles by appearing in a string of intense dramatic roles, mostly in smaller, independent films such as Manic (2001), with Don Cheadle; Mysterious Skin (2004), for writer/director Gregg Araki; Rian Johnson's award-winning debut film, Brick (2005); Lee Daniels' Shadowboxer (2005); the crime drama The Lookout (2007), which marked Scott Frank's directorial debut; John Madden's Killshot (2008), with Diane Lane and Mickey Rourke; and the controversial drama Stop-Loss (2008), in which he starred with Ryan Phillippe, under the direction of Kimberly Peirce. By 2009, Joseph was officially established as one of the leading men of indie cinema with his Golden Globe-nominated role in the comedy-drama 500 Days of Summer (2009), for which he also received an Independent Spirit Award nod. He also adapted the Elmore Leonard short story Sparks into a 24-minute short film that he directed (Sundance Film Festival 2009). In 2010, he headlined the indie drama Hesher (2010) and also established himself as a mainstream star in Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010). Balancing both independent and Hollywood film, Joseph scored another Golden Globe nod for the cancer drama 50/50 (2011), directed by Jonathan Levine and also starring Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, and Bryce Dallas Howard. He worked again with director Nolan on The Dark Knight Rises (2012) (for which he received a People's Choice Award nomination for Favorite Movie Actor), and snagged leading roles in both Premium Rush (2012), directed by David Koepp, and Looper (2012), for which he reunited with his Brick director, Rian Johnson, and starred opposite Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt. Also in 2012, he played Abraham Lincoln's son Robert in Steven Spielberg's Oscar-nominated Lincoln (2012), with Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field. In 2013, Joseph Gordon-Levitt starred in his critically-acclaimed feature film directorial debut, Don Jon, from a script he wrote, opposite Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for \"Best First Screenplay\" for the film. Gordon-Levitt provided the voice of Jiro Horikoshi in the 2014 English-language version of Hayao Miyazaki's Academy Award-nominated animated feature The Wind Rises, and appeared in Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014), in which he played Johnny, a character Miller created for the film. Gordon-Levitt founded and directs hitRECord, an open collaborative production. hitRECord creates and develops art and media collectively using their website where anyone with an internet connection can upload their records, download and remix others' records, and work on projects together. When the results of these RECords are produced and make money, hitRECord splits the profits 50/50 with everybody who contributed to the final production. hitRECord has published books, put out records, gone on tour and has screened their work at major festivals including Sundance and TIFF. \"RegularJOE\" (as he's known on the site) is leading the community of over 300, 000 artists in its biggest collaboration yet, a new take on a variety show called \"HitRecord on TV!\" The half hour series, which Gordon-Levitt hosts, premiered in January on Participant Media's new cable network, Pivot and has been renewed for a second season.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzOTg0NTkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ4MTcwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330687","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","nicknames":["Joe","Joey","JGL","Regular Joe"],"idIMDB":"nm0330687","born":"February 17, 1981 in Los Angeles, California, USA","starSign":"Aquarius","starMeter":"72%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"K Troop","year":" ","remarks":["Major Lewis Merrill (rumored)"],"imdbid":"tt5517318"},{"title":"Wingmen","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5441370"},{"title":"7500","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6436726"},{"title":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi","year":" 2017","remarks":["Slowen Lo (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2527336"},{"title":"Comrade Detective","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5834198"},{"title":"Straight Outta Oz","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5833706"},{"title":"Snowden","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3774114"},{"title":"The Muppets.","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4651824"},{"title":"The Night Before","year":" 2015/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3530002"},{"title":"The Walk","year":" 2015/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3488710"},{"title":"The Mindy Project","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2211129"},{"title":"The Interview","year":" 2014/II","remarks":["Joseph Gordon-Levitt (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt2788710"},{"title":"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0458481"},{"title":"Jimmy Kimmel Live!","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0320037"},{"title":"Le vent se lève","year":" 2013","remarks":["Jirô Horikoshi (English version, voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2013293"},{"title":"Don Jon","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2229499"},{"title":"Lincoln","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0443272"},{"title":"Looper","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1276104"},{"title":"Premium Rush","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1547234"},{"title":"The Dark Knight Rises","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1345836"},{"title":"50/50","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1306980"},{"title":"Inception: The Cobol Job","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt5295894"},{"title":"Inception","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1375666"},{"title":"Morgan and Destiny's Eleventeenth Date: The Zeppelin Zoo","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1640152"},{"title":"Elektra Luxx","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1340773"},{"title":"Morgan M.

Page wanted to start acting at an early age and attended the Neptune Theater School. She began her career at the age of 10 on the award-winning television series Pit Pony (1999), for which she received a Gemini nomination and a Young Artist Awards nomination. Later, Page appeared in Marion Bridge (2002), which won the award for Best Canadian First Feature at the Toronto International Film Festival. She won a Gemini Award for her role of Lilith in the first season of ReGenesis (2004), a one-hour drama for TMN/Movie Central, and for the cable feature, Mrs. Ashboro's Cat (2004), for Best Performance in a Children's or Youth Program or Series. In addition, Page appeared in the cult hit TV series Trailer Park Boys (2001). As the lead in David Slade's Hard Candy (2005), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, Page garnered much praise for her tour de force performance as a 14-year-old girl who meets a 30-year-old photographer on the Internet and then looks to expose him as pedophile. Films that followed included the title role of Bruce McDonald's The Tracey Fragments (2007); An American Crime (2007), also starring Catherine Keener; and the third installation of the X-Men franchise, X-Men: L'affrontement final (2006), where she played Kitty Pryde. With her breakout role in Jason Reitman's hit comedy Juno (2007), about an offbeat teenager who finds herself unexpectedly pregnant, Page received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG Best Actress nominations, and won the Independent Spirit Award for her performance. She followed up that turn with the lead in Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, the roller-derby comedy-drama Whip It (2009), Christopher Nolan's psychological thriller Inception (2010), the independent film Peacock (2010), and the dark comedy Super (2010), opposite Rainn Wilson and Liv Tyler. Page co-starred alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Alison Pill, Alec Baldwin, and Greta Gerwig in the Woody Allen ensemble comedy To Rome with Love (2012), and appeared in the thriller The East (2013), a story centered on a contract worker tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group, only to find herself falling for its leader.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MzM3MDYzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk1Mzc3NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680983","name":"Ellen Page","nicknames":["The

However, the versatile actor has been steadily working on both stage and screen since his television debut in the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001). After being cast in the World War II drama, Hardy left his studies at the prestigious Drama Centre in London and was subsequently cast as Twombly in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001) and as the villain Shinzon in Star Trek: Nemesis (2002). Edward Thomas Hardy was born on September 15, 1977 in Hammersmith, London; his mother, Elizabeth Anne (Barrett), is an artist and painter, and his father, Chips Hardy, is a writer. He is of English and Irish descent. Hardy was brought up in East Sheen, London, and first studied at Reed's School. His education continued at Tower House School, then at Richmond Drama School, and subsequently at the Drama Centre London, along with fellow Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender. After winning a modeling competition at age 21, he had a brief contract with the agency Models One. Tom spent his teens and early twenties battling delinquency, alcoholism and drug addiction; after completing his work on Star Trek: Nemesis (2002), he sought treatment and has also admitted that his battles with addiction ended his 5-year marriage to Sarah Ward. Returning to work in 2003, Hardy was awarded the Evening Standard Most Promising Newcomer Award for his theatre performances in the productions of \"In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings\" and \"Blood\". In 2003, Tom also co-starred in the play \"The Modernists\" with Paul Popplewell, Jesse Spencer and Orlando Wells. During the next five years, Hardy worked consistently in film, television and theatre, playing roles as varied as Robert Dudley in the BBC's The Virgin Queen (2005), Bill Sikes in Oliver Twist (2007) and starring in \"The Man of Mode\" at the National Theatre. On the silver screen, he appeared in the crime thriller Layer Cake (2004) with Daniel Craig, Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006), and the romp Scenes of a Sexual Nature (2006). In 2006, Hardy created \"Shotgun\", an underground theatre company along with director Robert Delamere, and directed a play, penned by his father for the company, called \"Blue on Blue\". In 2007, Hardy received a best actor BAFTA nomination for his touching performance as Stuart Shorter in the BBC adaptation of Alexander Masters' bestselling biography Stuart: A Life Backwards (2007). Hardy, hailed for his transformative character acting, was lauded for his emotionally and physically convincing portrayal in the ill-fated and warmhearted tale of Shorter, a homeless and occasionally violent man suffering from addiction and muscular dystrophy. The following year, he appeared as gay hoodlum Handsome Bob in the Guy Ritchie film RocknRolla (2008), but this would be his next transformation that would prove his extensive range and stun critics. In the film Bronson (2008), Hardy played the notorious Charles Bronson (given name, Michael Peterson), the \"most violent prisoner in Britain\". Bald, pumped-up, and outfitted with Bronson's signature strongman mustache, Hardy is unrecognizable and gives a harrowing performance that is physically fearless and psychologically unsettling. Director Nicolas Winding Refn breaks the fourth wall with Hardy retelling his tales directly to viewers as well as performing them outright before an audience of his own imagining. The performance mixes terrifying brutality, vaudevillian showmanship, wry humor, and an alarming amount of commitment, and won Hardy a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor. The performance got Hollywood's attention, and in 2009, Hardy was named one of Variety's \"10 Actors to Watch\". That year, he continued to garner praise for his starring role in The Take (2009), a four-part adaptation of Martina Cole's bestselling crime novel, as well as for his performance as Heathcliff in a version of Wuthering Heights (2009). Recent work includes the aforementioned breakthrough appearance in Inception (2010) alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard and Ellen Page. The movie was released in July 2010 and became one of top 25 highest grossing films of all time, collecting eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) and winning four. Other films include Warrior (2011), opposite Joel Edgerton, the story of two estranged brothers facing the fight of a lifetime from director Gavin O'Connor, and This Means War (2012), directed by McG and co-starring Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. Tom also starred in the heralded Cold War thriller, La taupe (2011) with Colin Firth and Gary Oldman. Hardy rejoined Christopher Nolan for The Dark Knight Rises (2012); he played the villain role of Bane opposite Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gary Oldman. Hardy's menacing physique and his character's scrambled, hard-to-distinguish voice became a major discussion point as the film was released. Outside of performing, Hardy is the patron for the charity \"Flack\", which is an organization to aid the recovery of the homeless in Cambridge. And in 2010, Hardy was named an Ambassador for The Prince's Trust, which helps disadvantaged youth. On the recent stage, he starred in the Brett C. Leonard play \"The Long Red Road\" in early 2010. Written for Hardy and directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, the play was staged at Chicago's Goodman Theater. In 2015, Hardy starred as the iconic Mad Max in George Miller's reboot of his franchise, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). He also collected a British Independent Film Award for his portrayal of both the Kray twins, Ronnie and Reggie, in Legend (2015), and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as John Fitzgerald in The Revenant (2015). Hardy also starred in the BBC Peaky Blinders, alongside Cillian Murphy, and in the TV series Taboo, both created by Steven Knight. He has an outlaw biker story among other projects in development. In 2010, Hardy became engaged to fellow English actress Charlotte Riley, whom he starred with in The Take (2009) and Wuthering Heights (2009), and is raising a young son, Louis, with ex-girlfriend Rachael Speed.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODEyNjA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE4ODMyMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0362766","name":"Tom

His mother, born in Indiana, was from a Swedish family, and his father was from Texas. Val studied at Hollywood's Professional's School and, in his teens, entered Juilliard's drama program. His professional acting career began on stage, and he still participates in theater; he played Hamlet at the 1988 Colorado Shakespeare Festival. His film debut was in the 1984 spoof Top Secret! (1984), wherein he starred as blond rock idol Nick Rivers. He was in a number of films throughout the 1980s, including the 1986 smash Top Gun (1986). Despite his obvious talent and range, it wasn't until his astonishingly believable performance as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors (1991) that the world sat up and took notice. Kilmer again put his good baritone to use in the movie, performing all of the concert pieces. Since then, he has played two more American legends, Elvis Presley in True Romance (1993) and Doc Holliday in Tombstone (1993). In July 1994, it was announced that Kilmer would be taking over the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne from Michael Keaton.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3ODIzMDA5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY0NTU4Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000174","name":"Val

characters, and the word \"ballsy\" is bound to pop up at least once. The British actress has made a point of eschewing straightforward pretty-girl parts in favor of more devilish damsels; as a result, she's built an eclectic resume that runs the gamut from Shakespearean tragedy to modern-day mysticism and erotica. Kate Elizabeth Winslet was born in Reading, Berkshire, into a family of thespians -- parents Roger Winslet and Sally Anne Bridges-Winslet were both stage actors, maternal grandparents Oliver and Linda Bridges ran the Reading Repertory Theatre, and uncle Robert Bridges was a fixture in London's West End theatre district. Kate came into her talent at an early age. She scored her first professional gig at eleven, dancing opposite the Honey Monster in a commercial for a kids' cereal. She started acting lessons around the same time, which led to formal training at a performing arts high school. Over the next few years, she appeared on stage regularly and landed a few bit parts in sitcoms. Her first big break came at age 17, when she was cast as an obsessive adolescent in Créatures célestes (1994). The film, based on the true story of two fantasy-gripped girls who commit a brutal murder, received modest distribution but was roundly praised by critics. Still a relative unknown, Winslet attended a cattle call audition the next year for Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility (1995). She made an immediate impression on the film's star, Emma Thompson, and beat out more than a hundred other hopefuls for the part of plucky Marianne Dashwood. Her efforts were rewarded with both a British Academy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Winslet followed up with two more period pieces, playing the rebellious heroine in Jude (1996) and Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996). The role that transformed Winslet from art house attraction to international star was Rose DeWitt Bukater, the passionate, rosy-cheeked aristocrat in James Cameron's Titanic (1997). Young girls the world over both idolized and identified with Winslet, swooning over all that face time opposite heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio and noting her refreshingly healthy, unemaciated physique. Winslet's performance also garnered a Best Actress nomination, making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy Award nominations. After the swell of unexpected attention surrounding Titanic (1997), Winslet was eager to retreat into independent projects. Rumor has it that she turned down the lead roles in both Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) in order to play adventurous soul searchers in Hideous Kinky (1998) and Holy Smoke (1999). The former cast her as a young single mother traveling through 1970s Morocco with her daughters in tow; the latter, as a zealous follower of a guru tricked into a \"deprogramming\" session in the Australian outback. The next year found her back in period dress as the Marquis de Sade's chambermaid and accomplice in Quills (2000). Kate holds the distinction of being the youngest actor ever honored with four Academy Award nominations (she received her fourth at age 29). As of 2016, she has been nominated for an Oscar seven times, winning one of them: she received the Best Actress Oscar for the drama The Reader (2008), playing a former concentration camp guard. For her performance of Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs (2015), she received her seventh Academy Award nomination. Off camera, Winslet is known for her mischievous pranks and familial devotion. She has two sisters, Anna Winslet and Beth Winslet (both actresses), and a brother, Joss. In 1998, she married assistant director Jim Threapleton. They had a daughter, Mia Honey Threapleton, in October 2000. They divorced in 2001. She later married director Sam Mendes in 2003 and gave birth to their son, Joe Alfie Winslet-Mendes, later that year.

His parents were amateur actors and managed a medical technical school. Billy has an older sister, actress and singer Lisa Zane. Billy was bitten by the acting bug early on. In his early teens, he attended Harand Camp of the Theater Arts in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin. In 1982, he attended the American School in Switzerland. His high school days were spent at Francis Parker High School in Chicago, Illinois. Daryl Hannah and Jennifer Beals also attended Parker, prior to Billy's attendance. Soon after graduating from high school, Billy decided to venture out to California to attempt acting for the first time. Within three weeks, he won his very first big screen role in Back to the Future (1985), playing the role of Match, one of Biff Tannen's thugs. He would later reprise that role for the sequel Back to the Future Part II (1989). Then after a small role in the science fiction horror film Critters (1986), he landed starring roles in several television films. Billy played villain Hughie Warriner in the Australian thriller film Calme blanc (1989), where he met his future wife, Lisa Collins. He also co-starred in Memphis Belle (1990), a film version of a 1944 documentary about a World War II bomber. In 1991, he appeared as John Justice Wheeler on several episodes of David Lynch's television series Twin Peaks (1990). Billy starred as the eponymous superhero in Le fantôme du Bengale (1996) and as Caledon Hockley in the billion dollar grossing Titanic (1997). Then, he starred in the television movie Cléopatre (1999) where he met his soon-to-be fiance, actress Leonor Varela from whom he subsequently separated. In 2005, he had a recurring role as the poetry loving ex-demon Drake on the television series Charmed (1998).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NzA2NTE0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAxMTUxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000708","name":"Billy

raised in Memphis, Tennessee. She is the youngest of three girls born to Bertye Kathleen (Talbot), a homemaker, and Langdon Doyle Bates, a mechanical engineer. Her grandfather was author Finis L. Bates. Kathy has English, as well as Irish, Scottish, and German, ancestry, and one of her ancestors, an Irish emigrant to New Orleans, once served as President Andrew Jackson's doctor. Kathy discovered acting appearing in high school plays and studied drama at Southern Methodist University, graduating in 1969. With her mind firmly set, she moved to New York City in 1970 and paid her dues by working everything from a cash register to taking lunch orders. Things started moving quickly up the ladder after giving a tour-de-force performance alongside Christopher Walken at Buffalo's Studio Arena Theatre in Lanford Wilson's world premiere of \"Lemon Sky\" in 1970, but she also had a foreshadowing of the heartbreak to come after the successful show relocated to New York's off-Broadway Playhouse Theatre without her and Walken wound up winning a Drama Desk award. By the mid-to-late 1970s, Kathy was treading the boards frequently as a rising young actress of the New York and regional theater scene. She appeared in \"Casserole\" and \"A Quality of Mercy\" (both 1975) before earning exceptional reviews for her role of Joanne in \"Vanities\". She took her first Broadway curtain call in 1980's \"Goodbye Fidel,\" which lasted only six performances. She then went directly into replacement mode when she joined the cast of the already-established and highly successful \"Fifth of July\" in 1981. Kathy made a false start in films with Taking Off (1971), in which she was billed as \"Bobo Bates\". She didn't film again until Straight Time (1978), starring Dustin Hoffman, and that part was not substantial enough to cause a stir. Things turned hopeful, however, when Kathy and the rest of the female ensemble were given the chance to play their respective Broadway parts in the film version of Robert Altman's Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982). It was a juicy role for Kathy and film audiences finally started noticing the now 34-year-old. Still and all, it was the New York stage that continued to earn Kathy awards and acclaim. She was pure textbook to any actor studying how to disappear into a role. Her characters ranged from free and life-affirming to downright pitiable. Despite winning a Tony Award nomination and Outer Critic's Circle Award for her stark, touchingly sad portrait of a suicidal daughter in 1983's \"'night, Mother\" and the Obie and Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for her powerhouse job as a romantic misfit in \"Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune,\" Kathy had no box-office pull and was hardly a strong consideration when the roles finally went to film. Kathy Bates was forever losing out when her award-winning stage characters transferred to the screen. First Sissy Spacek took on her potent role as the suicidal Jessie Cates in 'night, Mother (1986), then Michelle Pfeiffer seized the moment to play her dumpy lover character in Frankie and Johnny (1991). It would take Oscar glory to finally rectify the injustice. It was her fanatical turn as the drab, chunky, porcine-looking psychopath Annie Wilkes, who kidnaps her favorite author (James Caan) and subjects him to a series of horrific tortures, that finally turned the tide for her in Hollywood. With the 1990 shocker Misery (1990), based on the popular Stephen King novel, Bates and Caan were pure box office magic. Moreover, Kathy captured the \"Best Actress\" Oscar and Golden Globe award, a first in that genre (horror) for that category. To add to her happiness she married Tony Campisi, also an actor, in 1991. Quality film scripts now started coming her way and the 1990s proved to be a rich and rewarding time for her. First, she and another older \"overnight\" film star, fellow Oscar winner Jessica Tandy, starred together in the modern portion of the beautifully nuanced, flashback period piece Fried Green Tomatoes (1991). She then outdid herself as the detached and depressed housekeeper accused of murdering her abusive husband (David Strathairn) in Dolores Claiborne (1995). Surprisingly, she was left out of the Oscar race for these two excellent performances. Not so, however, for her flashy political advisor Libby Holden in the movie Primary Colors (1998) and her quirky, liberal mom in About Schmidt (2002), receiving \"Best Supporting Actress\" nominations for both. She also turned in a somewhat brief but potent turn as Gertrude Stein in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris (2011). Kathy has continued to work prolifically on TV as a multiple Emmy winner and nominee. She has also taken to directing a couple of TV-movies on the sly. She was nominated for a DGA award after helming an episode of \"Six Feet Under,\" in which she also had a recurring role. While some of her more recent movie parts have been unworthy of her talents, she has more than made up for it on TV playing everything from cruel-minded caricatures (Little Orphan Annie's Miss Hannigan) to common, decent every day folk in mini-movies. More recently she has done some eye-catching, offbeat turns on regular series such as The Office (2005), Harry's Law (2011) and especially American Horror Story (2011) for which she won an Emmy as Ethel Darling. Divorced from her husband since 1997, Kathy has been the Executive Committee Chair of the Actors Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Board of Governors.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg1MTM3NjcyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI0NTk0Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000870","name":"Kathy Bates","nicknames":["Bobo"],"idIMDB":"nm0000870","born":"June 28, 1948 in Memphis, Tennessee, USA","starSign":"Cancer","starMeter":"63%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"A Patriot","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt8343330"},{"title":"The Laureate","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1677615"},{"title":"The Highwaymen","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1860242"},{"title":"On the Basis of Sex","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4669788"},{"title":"American Horror Story","year":" 2013-2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1844624"},{"title":"The Big Bang Theory","year":" 2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0898266"},{"title":"Ma vie avec John F.

His mother, Lydia Robinson \"Robin\" (Rouse), was a foundation executive and teacher of English, and a daughter of famed real estate developer James Rouse, who developed Columbia, MD; she passed away of brain cancer on March 6, 1997. His father, Edward Mower Norton, Jr., was an environmental lawyer and conservationist, who works for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Edward has two younger siblings, James and Molly. From the age of five onward, the Yale graduate (majoring in history) was interested in acting. At the age of eight, he would ask his drama teacher what his motivation in a scene was. He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee's Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, Primal Fear (1996). The role was offered to Leonardo DiCaprio but he turned it down. Gere was on the verge of walking away from the project, fed up with the wait for a young star to be found, when Edward auditioned and won the role over 2000 other hopefuls. Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Primal Fear (1996). In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in American History X (1998). This performance earned him his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actor. He received his third Oscar nomination, for Best Supporting Actor, for his work in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014). His most prominent roles also include the critically acclaimed Everyone Says I Love You (1996), The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), Fight Club (1999), Dragon rouge (2002), 25th Hour (2002), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), The Illusionist (2006), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). He has also directed and co-written films, including his directorial debut, Keeping the Faith (2000). He has done uncredited work on the scripts for The Score (2001), Frida (2002), and The Incredible Hulk (2008). Alongside his work in cinema, Norton is an environmental and social activist, and is a member of the board of trustees of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit organization for developing affordable housing founded by his grandfather James Rouse.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNjQ5MTI1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU5MTI2Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001570","name":"Edward Norton","nicknames":["Ed"],"idIMDB":"nm0001570","born":"August 18, 1969 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA","starSign":"Leo","starMeter":"74%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Motherless Brooklyn","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0385887"},{"title":"L'île aux chiens","year":" 2018","remarks":["Rex (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5104604"},{"title":"Collateral Beauty","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4682786"},{"title":"Sausage Party","year":" 2016","remarks":["Sammy (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1700841"},{"title":"The Guardian Brothers","year":" 2016","remarks":["Yu Lei (English version, voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4788934"},{"title":"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3530232"},{"title":"La Nature Parle","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series short)"],"imdbid":"tt5786876"},{"title":"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2562232"},{"title":"The Grand Budapest Hotel","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2278388"},{"title":"Saturday Night Live","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072562"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 2000-2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096697"},{"title":"The Bourne Legacy","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1194173"},{"title":"Moonrise Kingdom","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1748122"},{"title":"The Dictator","year":" 2012","remarks":["Edward Norton (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1645170"},{"title":"Stone","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1423995"},{"title":"Modern Family","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1442437"},{"title":"Leaves of Grass","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1151359"},{"title":"The Invention of Lying","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1058017"},{"title":"Pride and Glory","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0482572"},{"title":"The Incredible Hulk","year":" 2008","remarks":["(Video Game)","Bruce Banner (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1221815"},{"title":"The Incredible Hulk","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0800080"},{"title":"Vanity Fair: Killers Kill, Dead Men Die","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Video short)","The Undercover Cop (as Ed Norton, credit only)"],"imdbid":"tt3492560"},{"title":"Le voile des illusions","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0446755"},{"title":"The Illusionist","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0443543"},{"title":"Stella","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0443409"},{"title":"Down in the Valley","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0398027"},{"title":"Kingdom of Heaven","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0320661"},{"title":"After the Sunset","year":" 2004","remarks":["Edward Norton (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0367479"},{"title":"The Italian Job","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0317740"},{"title":"25th Hour","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0307901"},{"title":"Dragon rouge","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0289765"},{"title":"Frida","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120679"},{"title":"Death to Smoochy","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0266452"},{"title":"The Score","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0227445"},{"title":"Keeping the Faith","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0171433"},{"title":"Fight Club","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0137523"},{"title":"American History X: Deleted Scenes","year":" 1998","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt8884146"},{"title":"American History X","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120586"},{"title":"Rounders","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0128442"},{"title":"The People vs. Larry Flynt","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117318"},{"title":"Everyone Says I Love You","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116242"},{"title":"Primal Fear","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117381"},{"title":"Only in America","year":" 1994","remarks":["(Video)","Duane / James / Bruno / ...

However, his portrayals of Billy Beane in Moneyball (2011), and Rusty Ryan in the remake of Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels, also loom large in his filmography. Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is the son of Jane Etta (Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company manager. He has a younger brother, Douglas (Doug) Pitt, and a younger sister, Julie Neal Pitt. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for \"el Pollo Loco\". Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This lead to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) and Cool World (1992). But Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in A River Runs Through It (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt's subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in True Romance (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994) and Legends of the Fall (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Se7en (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in Twelve Monkeys (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. Pitt's portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Troy (2004) helped establish his appeal as action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met his current partner Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence. He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamind (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Inglourious Basterds (2009) and The Tree of Life (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Moneyball (2011). In 2014, he starred in the war film Fury (2014), opposite Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Peña. Pitt and Jolie have six children, including two sons and a daughter who were adopted.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MjE2MTQ2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE5MDY0Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093","name":"Brad Pitt","idIMDB":"nm0000093","born":"December 18, 1963 in Shawnee, Oklahoma, USA","starSign":"Sagittarius","starMeter":"73%","filmographies":[{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Lewis and Clark","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(producer -

He made his film debut with a memorable role in cult film The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). In 1977, he and lyricist Jim Steinman released an operatic rock album called \"Bat Out Of Hell\", the record was huge and has sold 35,000,000 copies worldwide. However, the tour promoting the album took a toll on Meat's voice and left him unable to sing on the follow-up record \"Bad For Good\". Meat Loaf stayed in the dark through the eighties doing 4 records which never got any airplay or chart position in the US. Meat Loaf appeared in films Out of Bounds (1986) as a Pilot, and The Squeeze (1987) with Michael Keaton. But after getting back together with Steinman, they delivered a powerful sequel \"Bat Out Of Hell II\" which went to #1 in the US and UK. Bat II has now sold an excess of 20,000,000 copies. His TV credits include the Soldier being held prisoner in Vietnam in Lightning Force (1991), a mad Doctor who invents a serum to keep zombies from deteriorating in Monsters (1988) and a slick Landlord of a restaurant who ends up on the menu in HBO series Tales from the Crypt (1989). Meat Loaf has also appeared in La tête dans le carton à chapeaux (1999) and Fight Club (1999).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzNTQ4MjYyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzgwNTEzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001533","name":"Meat Loaf","idIMDB":"nm0001533","born":"September 27, 1947 in Dallas, Texas, USA","starSign":"Libra","starMeter":"70%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Ghost Wars","year":" 2017-2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt6856484"},{"title":"Elementary","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2191671"},{"title":"Meat Loaf: Going All the Way -

She began her career at age three as a Ford model, and also made appearances in over sixty television commercials, including spots for The Gap, Pizza Hut, Wendy's, and Jell-O (opposite Bill Cosby). Lohan made her acting debut in 1996 as the third actress to play Ali Fowler in the television drama Another World (1964). Shortly afterward she was hand-picked by Oscar-nominated writer Nancy Meyers as estranged twin sisters in an adaptation by Walt Disney Pictures of a novel by Erich Kästner, which marked Meyers' directorial debut. Lohan's first feature film, The Parent Trap (1998), a remake of The Parent Trap (1961), was a modest commercial success, earning her widespread critical acclaim and a Young Artist award for Best Leading Young Actress in a Feature Film, as well as Blockbuster Entertainment and YoungStar award nominations. After signing a three-movie contract with Disney, she returned to the small screen to star in the made-for-TV movies The Wonderful World of Disney: Life-Size (2000) (opposite Tyra Banks) and Get a Clue (2002) (opposite Bug Hall). She also appeared as Rose in the pilot episode of the short-lived comedy series Bette (2000), which starred Bette Midler. In June 2001 Lohan took a brief hiatus from acting. Her music career was launched over a year later, when Estefan Enterprises made a five-album production deal with her in September 2002, and she signed a recording contract with the reactivated Casablanca Records. However, Lohan was not turning her back on her blossoming acting career. Just over a month previously she had been cast opposite Jamie Lee Curtis for another Disney adaptation of a novel, this time a fantasy comedy by Mary Rodgers. Freaky Friday (2003), a remake of Freaky Friday (1976), was a huge hit (generating over $160 million in worldwide box office receipts) and critics were spellbound by delightful performances from Lohan and Curtis (who went on to receive a Golden Globe nomination for her work). In addition, Lohan won the 2004 MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female, as well as a Saturn award nomination and another Young Artist award nomination. Lohan relocated permanently to Los Angeles between projects and moved into an apartment with fellow actress Raven-Symoné. She also dated pop star Aaron Carter for a short time. Her next acting role was the title character in the comedy Journal intime d'une future star (2004), a Disney adaptation of the novel by Dyan Sheldon. The film received scathing reviews upon its release and died a quick death at the box office, but even the harshest of critics were impressed by Lohan's charming turn as aspiring actress Lola. Lohan's next project, Mean Girls (2004), saw her reunite with Freaky Friday (2003) director Mark Waters. Inspired by a non-fiction book by Rosalind Wiseman and written by Saturday Night Live (1975) scribe Tina Fey, the high-school comedy-drama opened to glowing reviews and grossed $86 million in the US. This earned her status as a bankable actress, and a salary of $7.5 million for the Donald Petrie romantic comedy Just My Luck (2006). One of the most sought-after young actresses in the industry, she starred in Bobby (2006) (opposite Demi Moore and Sharon Stone), the Disney fantasy adventure Herbie Fully Loaded (2005) (a pseudo-sequel to The Love Bug (1968)) and the critically acclaimed A Prairie Home Companion (2006). On top of a thriving film career Lohan also launched a music career, releasing her debut album, \"Speak,\" which hit shelves in December 2004. In 2009 Lohan launched her own fashion line titled 6126, mainly focusing on the production of women's leggings. By spring she launched a self-tanning spray line titled \"Sevin Nyne\" and by the end of the year she became an artistic designer for fashion house Ungaro. Lindsay continues her career in acting, having played a supporting role in the action film Machete (2010).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY1NzE3NTM2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4MDk5NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0517820","name":"Lindsay

She is of English, Welsh, Irish, and Scottish descent. Rachel became involved with acting as a teenager and by the age of 13 was performing in Shakespearean productions in summer theater camp; she went on to graduate with honors with a BFA degree in Theater from York University. After her debut in an episode of Disney's Jett Jackson (1998), she co-starred in the Canadian TV series Slings and Arrows (2003), a comedy-drama about the trials and travails of a Shakespearean theater group, and won a Gemini award for her performance in 2003. Her breakout role as Regina George in the hit comedy Mean Girls (2004) instantly catapulted her onto the short list of Hollywood's hottest young actresses. She followed that film with a star turn opposite Ryan Gosling in the adaptation of the Nicholas Sparks bestseller The Notebook (2004), which was a surprise box office success and became the predominant romantic drama for a new, young generation of moviegoers. After filming, McAdams and Gosling became romantically involved and dated through mid-2007. McAdams next showcased her versatility onscreen with the manic comedy Wedding Crashers (2005), the thriller Red Eye (2005), and the holiday drama The Family Stone (2005). McAdams then explored the independent film world with Married Life (2007), which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and also starred Pierce Brosnan, Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson. Starring roles in the military drama The Lucky Ones (2008), the newspaper thriller State of Play (2009), and the romance The Time Traveler's Wife (2009) followed before she starred opposite Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law in Guy Ritchie's international blockbuster Sherlock Holmes (2009). McAdams played the plucky producer of a failing morning TV show in Morning Glory (2010), the materialistic fiancée of Owen Wilson in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris (2011), and returned to romantic drama territory with the hit film The Vow (2012) opposite Channing Tatum. The actress also stars with Ben Affleck in Terrence Malick's To the Wonder (2012) and alongside Noomi Rapace in Brian De Palma's thriller Passion (2012). In 2005, McAdams received ShoWest's \"Supporting Actress of the Year\" Award as well as the \"Breakthrough Actress of the Year\" at the Hollywood Film Awards. In 2009, she was awarded with ShoWest's \"Female Star of the Year.\" As of 2011, she has been romantically linked with her Midnight in Paris (2011) co-star Michael Sheen.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5ODcxMDU4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAzNjQyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1046097","name":"Rachel

Her mother is Greek, born in Piraeus, while her father had German, Northern Irish, and English ancestry. Going by the name of Tina, Fey considered herself a \"supernerd\" during her high school and college years. She studied drama at the University of Virginia, and after graduating in 1992, she headed to Chicago, the ancestral home of American comedy. While working at a YMCA to support herself, she started Second City's first set of courses. After about nine months, a teacher told her to just skip ahead and audition for the more selective Second City Training Center. She failed but about eight weeks later, she re-auditioned and got into the year-long program. She ended up spending many years at The Second City in Chicago where many SNL cast members first started out. Then in 1995, Saturday Night Live (1975) came to The Second City's cast, including Fey's friend, Adam McKay, as a writer, searching for new talent. What they found was Tina Fey. When Adam was made Head writer, he suggested Fey should send a submission packet over the summer with six sketches, 10 pages each. Tina took the advice and sent them. After Lorne Michaels met her and saw her work she was offered a job a week later. She admitted that she was extremely nervous working in the legendary Studio 8H; being a foot shorter than everyone else, younger, and being one of the only female writers at the time. After a few years, Tina made history by becoming the first female head writer in the show's history. Tina also made her screen debut as a featured player during the 25th season by co-anchoring Weekend Update with Jimmy Fallon. Since Tina and Jimmy have taken over Weekend Update it has been considered the best ever. This year she made it to full fledged star by becoming a regular cast member, though she is hardly on the show, besides Update. And during the past two summers, Tina and Rachel Dratch performed their two-woman show to critical acclaim in both Chicago (1999) and New York (2000) and made their Aspen Comedy Festival Debut. Tina is married to Jeff Richmond, a Second City director and lives in New York City.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzMwMDI2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0MzcyNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0275486","name":"Tina Fey","idIMDB":"nm0275486","born":"May 18, 1970 in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, USA","starSign":"Taurus","starMeter":"70%","filmographies":[{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)","(created by -

Murray","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Bill Murray is an American actor, comedian, and writer. The fifth of nine children, he was born William James Murray in Wilmette, Illinois, to Lucille (Collins), a mailroom clerk, and Edward Joseph Murray II, who sold lumber. He is of Irish descent. Among his siblings are actors Brian Doyle-Murray, Joel Murray, and John Murray. He and most of his siblings worked as caddies, which paid his tuition to Loyola Academy, a Jesuit school. He played sports and did some acting while in that school, but in his words, mostly \"screwed off.\" He enrolled at Regis College in Denver to study pre-med but dropped out after being arrested for marijuana possession. He then joined the National Lampoon Radio Hour with fellow members Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, and John Belushi. However, while those three became the original members of Saturday Night Live (1975), he joined Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell (1975), which premiered that same year. After that show failed, he later got the opportunity to join Saturday Night Live (1975), for which he earned his first Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy-Variety or Music Series. He later went on to star in comedy films, including Arrête de ramer, t'es sur le sable (1979), Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981), Tootsie (1982), Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II (1989), Scrooged (1988), What About Bob? (1991), and Groundhog Day (1993). He also co-directed Quick Change (1990). Murray garnered additional critical acclaim later in his career, starring in Lost in Translation (2003), which earned him a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor, as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He also received Golden Globe nominations for his roles in Ghostbusters, Rushmore (1998), Hyde Park on Hudson (2012), St. Vincent (2014), and the HBO miniseries Olive Kitteridge (2014), for which he later won his second Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1OTM0MjEwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTQwNzI1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000195","name":"Bill

Her father, TV producer Sylvester L. Weaver Jr., originally wanted to name her Flavia, because of his passion for Roman history (he had already named her elder brother Trajan). Her mother, Elizabeth Inglis (née Desiree Mary Lucy Hawkins), was an English actress who had sacrificed her career for a family. Sigourney grew up in a virtual bubble of guiltless bliss, being taken care of by nannies and maids. By 1959, the Weavers had resided in 30 different households. In 1961, Sigourney began attending the Brearley Girls Academy, but her mother moved her to another New York private school, Chapin. Sigourney was quite rather taller than most of her other classmates (at age 13, she was already 5' 10\"), resulting in her constantly being laughed at and picked on; in order to gain their acceptance, she took on the role of class clown. In 1962, her family moved to San Francisco briefly, an unpleasant experience for her. Later, they moved back east to Connecticut, where she became a student at the Ethel Walker School, facing the same problems as before. In 1963, she changed her name to \"Sigourney\", after the character Sigourney Howard in F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" (her own birth name, Susan, was in honor of her mother's best friend, explorer Susan Pretzlik). Sigourney had already starred in a school drama production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", and, in 1965, she worked during the summer with a stock troupe, performing in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"You Can't Take It With You\" (she did not star in the latter because she was taller than the lead actor). After graduating from school in 1967, she spent some months in a kibbutz in Israel. At that time, she became engaged to reporter Aaron Latham, but they soon separated. In 1969, Sigourney enrolled in Stanford University, majoring in English Literature. She also participated in school plays, especially Japanese Noh plays. By that time, she was living in a tree house, alongside a male friend, dressed in elf-like clothes! After completing her studies in 1971, she applied for the Yale School of Drama in New Haven. Despite appearing at the audition reading a Bertolt Brecht speech and wearing a rope-like belt, she was accepted by the school but her professors rejected her, because of her height, and kept typecasting her as prostitutes and old women (whereas classmate Meryl Streep was treated almost reverently). However, in 1973, while making her theatrical debut with \"Watergate Classics\", she met up with a team of playwrights and actors and began hanging around with them, resulting in long-term friendships with Christopher Durang, Kate McGregor-Stewart and Albert Innaurato. In 1974, she starred in such plays as Aristophanes' \"Frogs\" and Durang's \"The Nature and Purpose of the Universe\" and \"Daryl and Carol and Kenny and Jenny\", as \"Jenny\". After finishing her studies that year, she began seriously pursuing a stage career, but her height kept being a hindrance. However, she continued working on stage with Durang (in \"Titanic\" [1975]) and Innaurato (in \"Gemini\" [1976]). Other 1970s stage works included \"Marco Polo Sing a Song\", \"The Animal Kingdom\", \"A Flea in Her Ear\", \"The Constant Husband\", \"Conjuring an Event\" and others. However, the one that really got her noticed was \"Das Lusitania Songspiel\", a play she co-wrote with Durang and in which she starred for two seasons, from 1979 to 1981. She was also up for a Drama Desk Award for it. During the mid-1970s, she appeared in several TV spots and even starred as Avis Ryan on the soap opera Somerset (1970). In 1977, she was cast in the role Shelley Duvall finally played in Annie Hall (1977), after rejecting the role due to prior stage commitments. In the end, however, Woody Allen offered her a role in the film that, while short (she was on-screen for six seconds), made many people sit up and take notice. She later appeared in Madman (1978) and, of course, Alien (1979). The role of the tough, uncompromising Ripley made Sigourney an overnight star and brought her a British Award nomination. She next appeared in Eyewitness (1981) and L'année de tous les dangers (1982), the latter being a great success in Australia that won an Oscar and brought Sigourney and co-star Mel Gibson to Cannes in 1983. The same year she delivered an honorary Emmy Award to her father, a few months before her uncle, actor Doodles Weaver, committed suicide. That year also brought her a romance with Jim Simpson, her first since having broken up two years previously with James M. McClure. She and Simpson were married on 1 October 1984. Meanwhile, Sigourney had played in the poorly received Deal of the Century (1983) and the mega-hit Ghostbusters (1984). She was also nominated for a Tony Award for her tour-de-force performance in the play \"Hurly Burly\". Then followed One Woman or Two (1985), Half Moon Street (1986) and Aliens (1986). The latter was a huge success, and Sigourney was nominated for both a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar. She then entered her most productive career period and snatched Academy Award nominations, in both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, for her intense portrayal of Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist (1988) and her delicious performance as a double-crossing, power-hungry corporate executive in Working Girl (1988). She ended up losing in both, but made up for it to a degree by winning both Golden Globe Awards. After appearing in a documentary about fashion photographer Helmut Newton, Helmut Newton: Frames from the Edge (1989), and reprising her role in the sequel Ghostbusters II (1989), she discovered she was pregnant and retired from public life for a while. She gave birth to her daughter, Charlotte Simpson, on 13 April 1990, and returned to the movies as a now skinhead Ripley in Alien³ (1992) and a gorgeous Queen Isabella of Spain in 1492: Christophe Colomb (1992), her second film with director Ridley Scott. She starred in the political comedy Dave (1993) alongside Kevin Kline, and then a Roman Polanski thriller, Death and the Maiden (1994). In 1995, she was seen in the romantic comedy Jeffrey (1995) and the mystery thriller Copycat (1995). The next year, she \"trod the boards\" in \"Sex and Longing\", yet another Durang play. She had not performed in the theater in many years before that play, her last stage performances occurring in the 1980s in \"As You Like It\" (1981), \"Beyond Therapy\" (1981), \"The Marriage of 'Bette and Boo'\" (1985) and \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1986). In 1997, she was the protagonist in Snow White: A Tale of Terror (1997), The Ice Storm (1997) and Alien: Resurrection (1997). Her performance in The Ice Storm (1997) gained her a BAFTA Award and another Golden Globe Award nomination. She also gave excellent performances in A Map of the World (1999) and the sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest (1999). However, her next comedy Company Man (2000) was not quite so warmly welcomed critically and financially. She next played a sexy con artist in Heartbreakers (2001) and had a voice role in Big Bad Love (2001). Her father died at age 93. Sigourney herself has recently starred in Tadpole (2000) and is planning a cinematic version of The Guys (2002), the enthralling September 11th one-act drama she played on stage on late 2001. At age 60, she played a crucial role in Avatar (2009), which became the top box-office hit of all time. The film reunited her with her Aliens (1986) director James Cameron. Her beauty, talent, and hard-work keeps the ageless actress going, and she has continued to win respect from her fans and directors.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MTcyNTE3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0MTMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000244","name":"Sigourney

She is the daughter of Betty DeGeneres (née Elizabeth Jane Pfeffer), a speech therapist, and Elliott Everett DeGeneres, an insurance agent. Her brother is musician and producer Vance DeGeneres. Her parents divorced when she was sixteen years old. Her mother remarried, and her new husband, salesman Roy Gruessendorf, moved the family to Atlanta, Texas. After graduating from Atlanta High School in 1976, Ellen attended the University of New Orleans as a communication major, but she dropped out after one semester. She held a wide variety of jobs until she turned to stand-up comedy, making her bones at small clubs and coffeehouses before working her way up to emcee Clyde's Comedy Club by 1981. Her comedy was described as a distaff version of Bob Newhart. Beginning in the early 1980s, she toured nationally and was named the funniest person in America after winning a competition sponsored by the cable network Showtime. This led to better gigs, including her first appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) in 1986. Though DeGeneres's early forays into series television were not successful (she appeared as a supporting player in two short-lived TV situation comedies in the period 1989-92, Open House (1989) and Laurie Hill (1992)), she scored a hit headlining her own 1994 sitcom on ABC \"These Friends of Mine\" (later renamed Ellen (1994) after its first season). She made TV history in April 1997 when her character, and DeGeneres herself personally, revealed that she was a lesbian. However, the show was canceled the following season due to declining ratings, after which DeGeneres returned to the stand-up circuit. In 2001, DeGeneres launched a new series, The Ellen Show (2001), on CBS, but it suffered from poor ratings and was canceled. Redemption as a television artiste came in 2003, when DeGeneres's daytime talk show, Ellen: The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003) proved to be both a critical hit and a commercial success. Along with good ratings, the show has won unprecedented kudos from the industry, winning 15 Emmy Awards in its first three seasons on the air and becoming the first talk show in TV history to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show in its first three seasons. DeGeneres has also made a name for herself as a host of awards shows. She hosted the Grammy Awards in 1996 and 1997, as well as the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2001 and 2005. In February 2007, she had the ultimate TV awards show gig, hosting the Oscars, which she hosted again in 2014.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAwMzAyNDEzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU3MTAxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001122","name":"Ellen DeGeneres","idIMDB":"nm0001122","born":"January 26, 1958 in Metairie, Louisiana, USA","starSign":"Aquarius","starMeter":"42%","filmographies":[{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Jekyll","year":" ","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt5697510"},{"title":"Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase","year":" 2019","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt8323104"},{"title":"Couple Time","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Movie)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt2356794"},{"title":"Little Funny","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt6068934"},{"title":"Ellen's Game of Games","year":" 2017-2018","remarks":["(TV Series)","(executive producer -

Since then, he has collaborated with directors who represent a virtual encyclopedia of modern cinema: Kathryn Bigelow, Sam Raimi, Alan Parker, Walter Hill, Mary Harron, Wim Wenders, Anton Corbijn, Zhang Yimou, Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Oliver Stone, William Friedkin, Werner Herzog, Lars Von Trier, Abel Ferrara, Spike Lee, Julian Schnabel, David Cronenberg, Paul Schrader, Anthony Minghella, Scott Cooper, Theo Angelopoulos, Christian Carion, Robert Rodriguez, Phillip Noyce, Hector Babenco, John Milius, Roger Donaldson, Paul McGuigan, Lee Tamahori, Roger Spottiswoode, Paul Weitz, Daniel Nettheim, The Spierig Brothers, Andrew Stanton, and Josh Boone. Dafoe has been recognized with three Academy Award nominations: Best Actor in a Supporting Role for The Florida Project, Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Platoon, as well as Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Shadow Of The Vampire, for which he also received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations. Among his nominations and awards, he has received an Honorary Golden Bear from the Berlin Film Festival and awards from the National Society of Film Critics as well as Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York Film Critics as well as an Independent Spirit Award. Willem was born in Appleton, Wisconsin, to Muriel Isabel (Sprissler), a nurse, and William Alfred Dafoe, a surgeon. He is of mostly German, Irish, Scottish, and English descent. He and his wife, director Giada Colagrande, have made three films together: Padre, A Woman, and Before It Had A Name. His natural adventurousness is evident in roles as diverse as the elite assassin who is mentor to Keanu Reeves in the neo-noir John Wick, in his voice work as Gil the Moorish Idol in Finding Nemo and as Ryuk the Death God in Death Note, and as the obsessed FBI agent in the cult classic The Boondock Saints, Sean Baker's The Florida Project and Kenneth Branagh's Murder on the Orient Express. That adventurous spirit continues with upcoming films including James Wan's Aquaman, Robert Eggers's The Lighthouse, Edward Norton's Motherless Brooklyn and Julian Schnabel's At Eternity's Gate in which he stars as Vincent Van Gogh. Dafoe is one of the founding members of The Wooster Group, the New York based experimental theatre collective. He created and performed in all of the group's work from 1977 thru 2005, both in the U.S. and internationally. Since then, he worked with Richard Foreman in Idiot Savant at The Public Theatre (NYC) and most recently two international productions with Robert Wilson: The Life & Death of Marina Abramovic and The Old Woman opposite Mikhail Baryshnikov. He is developing a new theatre piece, directed by Romeo Castellucci, based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Minister's Black Veil.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNjU2MTYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY5MDY4NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000353","name":"Willem

With an amazing list of credits to his name, he has managed to stay new and fresh even after over four decades in the business. Downey was born April 4, 1965 in Manhattan, New York, the son of writer, director and filmographer Robert Downey Sr. and actress Elsie Downey (née Elsie Ann Ford). Robert's father is of half Lithuanian Jewish, one quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one quarter Irish, descent, while Robert's mother was of English, Scottish, German, and Swiss-German ancestry. Robert and his sister, Allyson Downey, were immersed in film and the performing arts from a very young age, leading Downey Jr. to study at the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York, before moving to California with his father following his parents' 1978 divorce. In 1982, he dropped out of Santa Monica High School to pursue acting full time. Downey Sr., himself a drug addict, exposed his son to drugs at a very early age, and Downey Jr. would go on to struggle with abuse for decades. Downey Jr. made his debut as an actor at the age of five in the film Pound (1970), written and directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr.. He built his film repertoire throughout the 1980s and 1990s with roles in Tuff Turf (1985), Weird Science (1985), True Believer (1989), and Wonder Boys (2000) among many others. In 1992, Downey received an Academy Award nomination and won the BAFTA (British Academy Award) for Best Actor for his performance in the title role of Chaplin (1992). In Robert Altman's Short Cuts (1993), he appeared as an aspiring film make-up artist whose best friend commits murder. In Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994), with Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, Downey starred as a tabloid TV journalist who exploits a murderous couple's killing spree to boost his ratings. For the comedy Heart and Souls (1993), Downey starred as a young man with a special relationship with four ghosts. In 1995, Downey starred in Restoration (1995), with Hugh Grant, Meg Ryan and Ian McKellen, directed by Michael Hoffman. Also that year, he starred in Richard III (1995), in which he appears opposite his Restoration (1995) co-star McKellen. In 1997, Downey was seen in Robert Altman's The Gingerbread Man (1998), alongside Kenneth Branagh, Daryl Hannah and Embeth Davidtz; in One Night Stand (1997), directed by Mike Figgis and starring Wesley Snipes and Nastassja Kinski; and in Hugo Pool (1997), directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr. and starring Sean Penn and Patrick Dempsey. In September of 1999, Downey appeared in Black & White (1999), written and directed by James Toback, along with Ben Stiller, Elijah Wood, Gaby Hoffmann, Brooke Shields and Claudia Schiffer. In January of 1999, he starred with Annette Bening and Aidan Quinn in In Dreams (1999), directed by Neil Jordan. In 2000, Downey co-starred with Michael Douglas and Tobey Maguire in Wonder Boys (2000), directed by Curtis Hanson. In this dramatic comedy, Downey played the role of a bisexual literary agent. In 2001, Downey made his prime-time television debut when he joined the cast of the Fox-TV series Ally McBeal (1997) as attorney \"Larry Paul\". For this role, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male in a Comedy Series. In addition, Downey was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. The actor's drug-related problems escalated from 1996 to 2001, leading to arrests, rehab visits and incarcerations, and he was eventually fired from Ally McBeal (1997). Emerging clean and sober in 2003, Downey Jr. began to rebuild his career. He marked his debut into music with his debut album, titled \"The Futurist\", on the Sony Classics Label on November 23rd, 2004. The album's eight original songs, that Downey wrote, and his two musical numbers debuting as cover songs revealed his sultry singing voice and his musical talents. Downey displayed his versatility in two different films in October 2003: the musical/drama The Singing Detective (2003), a remake of the BBC hit of the same name, and the thriller Gothika (2003) starring Halle Berry and Penélope Cruz. Downey starred in powerful yet humbling roles inspired by real-life accounts of some of history's most precious kept secrets, including Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly (2006) in 2006 co-starring Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder and Woody Harrelson, and Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus (2006) co-starring Nicole Kidman, a film inspired by the life of Diane Arbus, the revered photographer whose images captured attention in the early 1960s. These roles exhibited Downey's momentum from the previous year of 2005, in which he starred in the Academy Award®-nominated feature film Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005), directed by George Clooney and in Shane Black's action comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) co-starring Val Kilmer. In 2007, he co-starred in David Fincher's suspenseful Zodiac (2007), alongside Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo, about the notorious serial killer who haunted San Francisco during the 1970s. In May 2008, Downey achieved critical acclaim and worldwide box office success for his starring role in Iron Man (2008), Jon Favreau's big-screen rendering of the Marvel comic book superhero. The film co-starred Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. In August of 2008, Downey starred with Ben Stiller and Jack Black in the comedy Tropic Thunder (2008), and went on to receive an Academy Award®-nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his, Kirk Lazarus. In December 2009, Downey starred in the action-adventure Sherlock Holmes (2009). The film, directed by Guy Ritchie, co-starred Jude Law and Rachel McAdams and earned Downey a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical in January of 2010. In early Summer 2010, Downey re-teamed with director Jon Favreau and reprised his role as \"Tony Stark/Iron Man\" in the hugely successful sequel to the original film, Iron Man 2 (2010), starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson and Mickey Rourke. Downey next starred in Due Date (2010), a comedy directed by Todd Phillips, in which he plays the role of an expectant father on a road trip racing to get back in time for the birth of his first child. Due Date (2010), starring The Hangover (2009)'s Zach Galifianakis, was released in November 2010. Downey was honored by Time Magazine's \"Time 100\" in 2008, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. His laurels include two Academy Award nominations, three Golden Globe wins, numerous other award nominations and wins, and tremendous popular and commercial success, particularly in his roles as Sherlock Holmes and Tony Stark (the latter of which he has so far played in Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). For three consecutive years, from 2012 to 2015, Downey has topped the Forbes list of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, making an estimated $80 million in earnings between June 2014 and June 2015. In 2005, Downey Jr. married Susan Downey, with whom he has two children. Downey also has another son, Indio Falconer Downey, born 1993, from his first marriage to Deborah Falconer, from whom he was officially divorced in 2004. Robert has jump-started the Team Downey Production Company with wife Susan Downey.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg1MTUyNDYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ4MTE2MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375","name":"Robert Downey

He was raised in Cleveland, Ohio. His love for acting came naturally, through summers spent with his great-grandmother, New York stage actress Minnie Gentry. He later began his acting career after being discovered on a New York City street by a casting director. Soon, he followed with several notable TV appearances on shows such as Living Single (1993), NYPD Blue (1993) and Soul Food (2000). He became well known for his lead role in the UPN TV series Sparks (1996). Howard broke onto the big screen with his riveting performance in Mr. Holland's Opus (1995). Howard's most memorable performances to date are of scene-stealing characters such as \"Cowboy\" in the Hughes brother's film Dead Presidents (1995) and as \"Quentin\" in Malcolm D. Lee's Independent film The Best Man (1999). The latter earning him a NAACP Image Award, Independent Spirit Award nomination and a Chicago Film Critics Award nomination. A self taught musician, Howard plays both the piano and the guitar. You can see Terrence display his musical talents opposite Jamie Foxx in this year's breakout film Ray (2004).

Los Angeles, California, the son of well-known film and TV star Lloyd Bridges and his long-time wife Dorothy Dean Bridges (née Simpson). He grew up amid the happening Hollywood scene with big brother Beau Bridges. Both boys popped up, without billing, alongside their mother in the film The Company She Keeps (1951), and appeared on occasion with their famous dad on his popular underwater TV series Sea Hunt (1958) while growing up. At age 14, Jeff toured with his father in a stage production of \"Anniversary Waltz\". The \"troublesome teen\" years proved just that for Jeff and his parents were compelled at one point to intervene when problems with drugs and marijuana got out of hand. He recovered and began shaping his nascent young adult career appearing on TV as a younger version of his father in the acclaimed TV- movie Silent Night, Lonely Night (1969), and in the strange Burgess Meredith film Le 3eme oeil (1970). Following fine notices for his portrayal of a white student caught up in the racially-themed Halls of Anger (1970), his career-maker arrived just a year later when he earned a coming-of-age role in the critically-acclaimed ensemble film The Last Picture Show (1971). The Peter Bogdanovich- directed film made stars out off its young leads (Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd) and Oscar winners out of its older cast (Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman). The part of Duane Jackson, for which Jeff received his first Oscar-nomination (for \"best supporting actor\"), set the tone for the types of roles Jeff would acquaint himself with his fans -- rambling, reckless, rascally and usually unpredictable). Owning a casual carefree handsomeness and armed with a perpetual grin and sly charm, he started immediately on an intriguing 70s sojourn into offbeat filming. Chief among them were his boxer on his way up opposite a declining Stacy Keach in Fat City (1972); his Civil War-era conman in the western Bad Company (1972); his redneck stock car racer in The Last American Hero (1973); his young student anarchist opposite a stellar veteran cast in Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh (1973); his bank-robbing (also Oscar-nominated) sidekick to Clint Eastwood in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974); his aimless cattle rustler in Rancho Deluxe (1975); his low-level western writer who wants to be a real-life cowboy in Hearts of the West (1975); and the brother of an assassinated President who pursues leads to the crime in Winter Kills (1979). All are simply marvelous characters that should have propelled him to the very top rungs of stardom...but strangely didn't. Perhaps it was his trademark ease and naturalistic approach that made him somewhat under appreciated at that time when Hollywood was run by a Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino-like intensity. Neverthless, Jeff continued to be a scene-stealing favorite into the next decade, notably as the video game programmer in the 1982 science-fiction cult classic TRON (1982), and the struggling musician brother vying with brother Beau Bridges over the attentions of sexy singer Michelle Pfeiffer in The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989). Jeff became a third-time Oscar nominee with his highly intriguing (and strangely sexy) portrayal of a blank-faced alien in Starman (1984), and earned even higher regard as the ever-optimistic inventor Preston Tucker in Tucker: The Man and His Dream (1988). Since then Jeff has continued to pour on the Bridges magic on film. Few enjoy such an enduring popularity while maintaining equal respect with the critics. The Fisher King (1991), American Heart (1992), Fearless (1993), The Big Lebowski (1998) (now a cult phenomenon) and The Contender (2000) (which gave him a fourth Oscar nomination) are prime examples. More recently he seized the moment as a bald-pated villain as Robert Downey Jr.'s nemesis in Iron Man (2008) and then, at age 60, he capped his rewarding career by winning the elusive Oscar, plus the Golden Globe and Screen Actor Guild awards (among many others), for his down-and-out country singer Bad Blake in Crazy Heart (2009). Bridges next starred in TRON: Legacy (2010), reprising one of his more famous roles, and received another Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his role in the Western remake True Grit (2010). In 2014, he co-produced and starred in an adaptation of the Lois Lowry science fiction drama The Giver (2014). Jeff has been married since 1977 to non-professional Susan Geston (they met on the set of Rancho Deluxe (1975)). The couple have three daughters, Isabelle (born 1981), Jessica (born 1983), and Hayley (born 1985). He hobbies as a photographer on and off his film sets, and has been known to play around as a cartoonist and pop musician. His ancestry is English, and smaller amounts of Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), Irish, Swiss-German, and German.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTU1NjM4MDYzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIwMjMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000313","name":"Jeff

was born in Los Angeles, the daughter of noted producer and director Bruce Paltrow and Tony Award-winning actress Blythe Danner. Her father was from a Jewish family, while her mother is of mostly German descent. When Gwyneth was eleven, the family moved to Massachusetts, where her father began working in summer stock productions in the Berkshires. It was here that she received her early acting training under the tutelage of her parents. She graduated from the all-girls Spence School in New York City and moved to California where she attended the UC Santa Barbara, majoring in Art History. She soon quit, realizing it was not her passion. She made her film debut with a small part in Shout (1991) and for the next five years had featured roles in a mixed bag of film fare that included Flesh and Bone (1993); Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994); Se7en (1995); Jefferson in Paris (1995); Moonlight and Valentino (1995); and The Pallbearer (1996). It was her performance in the title role of Emma Woodhouse in Emma (1996) that led to her being offered the role of Viola in Shakespeare in Love (1998), for which she was awarded the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Her roles have also included The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Shallow Hal (2001), Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004), Iron Man (2008), Two Lovers (2008), and Country Strong (2010). She has two children with her former husband, English musician Chris Martin.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzIxOTQ1NTU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ4MDY0Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000569","name":"Gwyneth

The eldest of four children, Scott has two brothers and one sister. He spent the majority of his formative years in southern Florida, then moved with his family to Los Angeles when his career began to take off. Scott first became interested in acting in the third grade, when an actor gave a presentation for Career Day. He relentlessly pestered his parents to get him an agent until they finally realized that the young tyke was serious about becoming an actor. His first gig was a national commercial for Ideal Toys. In fall 1994, Scott left the LA scene to fulfill yet another dream--attending Harvard University. Taking leave of the TV series Full House (1987) didn't suggest he was leaving the business altogether. He continued as the voice of Aladdin (1992) in the Saturday morning TV series, completed two more full length Aladdin videos, and made a final appearance on \"Full House,\" all while maintaining excellent grades at school. As if all of that didn't keep the ambitious lad busy enough, he also held a part-time job as a youth correspondent for Good Morning America (1975). Scott majored in English and minored in French literature while at Harvard, and he graduated magna cum laude in June of 1998. In his first online interview after returning to Los Angeles, he still seemed to be undecided about what his plans were, which were narrowed down to writing, directing, acting, and news correspondence. Since his return to Hollywood, he has starred in a horror flick, Shredder (2001); produced an award winning film short called The Cricket Player (2002); and provided his voice for the English-language dub of Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis (2001), Disney/Square Co.'s video game Kingdom Hearts (2002), \"Mickey's Philharmagic,\" and \"The Search for Mickey Mouse\"! Scott considers himself to be a writer, primarily, and an actor, secondarily.

Charles Cooper was born on January 5, 1975 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His mother, Gloria (Campano), is of Italian descent, and worked for a local NBC station. His father, Charles John Cooper, who was of Irish descent, was a stockbroker. Immediately after Bradley graduated from the Honors English program at Georgetown University in 1997, he moved to New York City to enroll in the Masters of Fine Arts program at the Actors Studio Drama School at New School University. There, he developed his stage work, culminating with his thesis performance as John Merrick in Bernard Pomerance's \"The Elephant Man\", performed in New York's Circle in the Square. While still in school, Bradley began his professional career, appearing opposite Sarah Jessica Parker on Sex and the City (1998) and on the drama series The Beat (2000). His weekends were spent with LEAP (Learning through the Expanded Arts Program), a non-profit organization that teaches acting and movement to inner city school children. The summers took him all across the globe, from kayaking in British Columbia with Orca Whales to ice-climbing in the Peruvian Andes, while hosting Lonely Planet's Treks in a Wild World (2000) for the Discovery Channel. Bradley had to miss his graduation ceremony from the Actors Studio in order to star in his first feature Wet Hot American Summer (2001). After finishing his second feature Bending All the Rules (2002), his plans to relocate to Los Angeles were delayed when Darren Star hired him to star on the drama series The $treet (2000). Bradley went on to win the role of young law student Gordon Pinella in Changing Lanes (2002), starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson, and also played Travis Paterson in My Little Eye (2002). He finally decided that it was time to forgo his other New York projects and move to Los Angeles when he was cast on Alias (2001). After supporting roles in Wedding Crashers (2005), Failure to Launch (2006), The Comebacks (2007), The Rocker (2008) and Yes Man (2008), Cooper broke out with major roles in Ce que pensent les hommes (2009), The Hangover (2009) and Valentine's Day (2010). He co-starred in the action film The A-Team (2010) and headlined the thriller film Limitless (2011). Cooper received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor after starring opposite Jennifer Lawrence in David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook (2012). He then received two more consecutive Oscar nominations, Best Supporting Actor for playing Richie DiMaso in Russell's American Hustle (2013) (again opposite Lawrence, though their characters shared no significant screen time), and Best Actor for playing Navy SEAL Chris Kyle in Clint Eastwood's American Sniper (2014), the highest grossing film of 2014. During this time period, Cooper also reprised his role in The Hangover Part II (2011) and The Hangover Part III (2013), turned in another strong dramatic turn in The Place Beyond the Pines (2012), and voiced Rocket Raccoon in the third highest grossing film of 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). In 2015, Bradley headlined two comedies, Cameron Crowe's Aloha (2015), set in Hawaii, and John Wells' Burnt (2015), set in London, and starred opposite Jennifer Lawrence again in David O. Russell's Joy (2015). Bradley has a daughter (born 2017) with his partner, model Irina Shayk.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0OTIyMzY1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg0OTE0NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177896","name":"Bradley

His father is of Greek descent and his mother is of mostly English and Scottish ancestry. Zach moved to New York City after failing his last college class by one point. Zach got his start performing his brand of humor in the back of a hamburger joint in Times Square. He toured the country, performing in coffee shops and universities. After more than a decade performing stand-up and making both television and film appearances, Zach broke through to wider recognition with his co-starring role as \"Alan Garner\", in the comedy mega-hit, The Hangover (2009). Later that year, he played a large role in the CGI-heavy kids movie, G-Force (2009), and then appeared in memorable supporting parts in the films, Up in the Air (2009) (as a laid-off employee), Youth in Revolt (2009) (as a loutish stepfather), and Dinner for Schmucks (2010), as one of the title characters. More recently, he co-starred with Keir Gilchrist in the teen dramedy, It's Kind of a Funny Story (2010), with Robert Downey Jr. in the road trip comedy, Due Date (2010), and alongside Will Ferrell in the political spoof, The Campaign (2012). He also voiced \"Humpty Dumpty\" in the animated film, Puss in Boots (2011), and reprised his character in both The Hangover Part II (2011) and The Hangover Part III (2013). In 2014, he appeared in the winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014), and in 2016, he starred in the comedies Masterminds (2016) and Keeping Up with the Joneses (2016), released three weeks apart.

His parents are actors Robert Pine and Gwynne Gilford, and his maternal grandparents were Max M. Gilford, a president of the Hollywood Bar Association, and actress Anne Gwynne. His sister, Katherine Pine, has also acted. Chris's ancestry is Russian Jewish (from his maternal grandfather), English, German, Welsh, and French. Pine attended Oakwood School in the San Fernando Valley, and went on to study English at the University of California, Berkeley where he received a bachelor's degree. During this time, he spent one year studying at the University of Leeds in England. Pine also studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. After embarking on an acting career, Pine won guest roles in many television series, and made his feature film debut opposite Anne Hathaway in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004). Other roles in film and television followed, but he became an international star when he was cast as James T. Kirk in the hugely successful franchise reboot, Star Trek (2009). He subsequently starred in the films Unstoppable (2010), This Means War (2012), People Like Us (2012), and the sequel Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013). In 2014, Pine co-starred in Horrible Bosses 2 (2014) and, as Cinderella's Prince, in the musical Into the Woods (2014), alongside Meryl Streep and Anna Kendrick.

Nimoy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Dora (Spinner) and Max Nimoy, who owned a barbershop. His parents were Ukrainian Jewish immigrants. Raised in a tenement and acting in community theaters since age eight, Nimoy did not make his Hollywood debut until he was 20, with a bit part in Queen for a Day (1951) and another as a ballplayer in the perennial Rhubarb (1951). After two years in the United States Army, he was still getting small, often uncredited parts, like an Army telex operator in Them! (1954). His part as Narab, a Martian finally friendly to Earth, in the closing scene in the corny Republic serial Zombies of the Stratosphere (1952), somewhat foreshadowed the role which would make him a household name: Mr. Spock, the half-human/half-Vulcan science officer on Star Trek (1966) one of television's all-time most successful series. His performance won him three Emmy nominations and launched his career as a writer and director, notably of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986), the story of a humpback whale rescue that proved the most successful of the Star Trek movies. Stage credits have included \"Fiddler on the Roof\", \"Oliver\", \"Camelot\" and \"Equus\". He has hosted the well-known television series In Search of... (1976) and Ancient Mysteries (1994), authored several volumes of poetry and guest-starred on two episodes of The Simpsons (1989). In the latter years of his career, he played Mustafa Mond in NBC's telling of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1998), voiced Sentinel Prime in the blockbuster Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), and played Spock again in two new Star Trek films, Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013). Leonard Nimoy died on February 27, 2015 in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was 83.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMzY1MzEyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjU4MTg1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000559","name":"Leonard Nimoy","nicknames":["Lenny"],"idIMDB":"nm0000559","born":"March 26, 1931 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA","died":"February 27, 2015 (age 83) in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, USA","starSign":"Aries","starMeter":"69%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video Game)","Spock (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4916238"},{"title":"Star Trek: Into Darkness","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1408101"},{"title":"Drôles d'oiseaux","year":" 2012","remarks":["Sekhuru (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1488181"},{"title":"Fringe","year":" 2009-2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1119644"},{"title":"Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video Game)","Master Xehanort (English version, voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2125539"},{"title":"The Big Bang Theory","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0898266"},{"title":"Billy Blackburn's Treasure Chest: Rare Home Movies and Special Memories","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt3474528"},{"title":"Transformers: Dark of the Moon","year":" 2011","remarks":["Sentinel Prime (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1399103"},{"title":"Bruno Mars: The Lazy Song - Alternate Version","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt4042114"},{"title":"Star Trek Online","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video Game)","Spock Prime (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0931112"},{"title":"Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video Game)","Master Xehanort (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1390843"},{"title":"Star Trek Evolutions","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Video short)","Narrator (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3255584"},{"title":"Land of the Lost","year":" 2009","remarks":["The Zarn (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0457400"},{"title":"Star Trek","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0796366"},{"title":"Civilization IV","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Video Game)","Narrator (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0488998"},{"title":"Futurama","year":" 1999-2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0149460"},{"title":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","year":" 2001","remarks":["(Video Game)","King Kashekim Nedakh (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0313229"},{"title":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","year":" 2001","remarks":["Atlantean King (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0230011"},{"title":"Becker","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0174378"},{"title":"Sinbad: Beyond the Veil of Mists","year":" 2000","remarks":["Akron / Baraka / King Chandra (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0144608"},{"title":"Rashi: A Light After the Dark Ages","year":" 1999","remarks":["Rashi (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0223992"},{"title":"Seaman","year":" 1999","remarks":["(Video Game)","Narrator (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0369908"},{"title":"The Lost World","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0938313"},{"title":"Invasion America","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0161718"},{"title":"Brave New World","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0145600"},{"title":"The First Men in the Moon","year":" 1997","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0197466"},{"title":"Duckman: Private Dick/Family Man","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108755"},{"title":"David","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0118933"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 1993-1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096697"},{"title":"Au-delà du réel - l'aventure continue","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0112111"},{"title":"Bonanza: Under Attack","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0112554"},{"title":"The Pagemaster","year":" 1994","remarks":["Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0110763"},{"title":"Star Trek: Judgment Rites","year":" 1993","remarks":["(Video Game)","Cmdr.

Banadinovic","height":"6' 2½\" (1.89 m)","bio":"Eric Bana was born Eric Banadinovic on August 9, 1968, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. He is the younger of two brothers. His father, named Ivan Banadinovic, came from Zagreb, Croatia, and worked as a manager for Caterpillar Inc. His mother, named Eleanor Banadinovic, came from a German family and was a hairdresser. Young Bana grew up in suburban Melbourne. He was popular among his schoolmates for his talent of making comic impressions of his teachers. At that time, he was fond of Mel Gibson in Mad Max (1979) and also decided to become an actor. He moved to Sydney and worked odd jobs to support himself. In 1991, he began a career as a stand-up comedian, while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. In 1993, Bana made his television debut on Steve Vizard's Tonight Live with Steve Vizard (1990) talk show, then joined the Full Frontal (1993) TV-series. He gained popularity for making impressions of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Tom Cruse and \"Colombo\". In 1996, he started his own show titled Eric (1997), then launched a comedy series titled The Eric Bana Show Live (1997). The show was canceled for the lack of substantial audience, however, in 1997, Bana received the Logie Award for \"Most Popular Comedian\" for his work on The Eric Bana Show Live (1997). He made his film debut in Une maison de rêve (1997), in a supporting comic role. That same year, he was cast to portray Mark \"Chopper\" Read, the notorious Australian underworld figure. For the role, Bana gained 30 pounds, by eating junk food; he also spent a few days with Read in prison, in order to perfect his mimicry. Bana completely transformed himself into a bald, fat, disturbed criminal. He would arrive on the film set at four in the morning, spending several hours in makeup, being tattooed exactly like Read. Chopper (2000) became an international success and won three Australian Film Institute Awards. Bana won the Best Actor at the 2000 Stockholm Film Festival and also the AFI 2000 Best Actor Award. Then he co-starred in Black Hawk Down (2001), then starred in Hulk (2003). In 2002, he was cast as a Trojan \"Prince Hector\" in the historical epic Troy (2004), after being recommended by Brad Pitt, who admired Bana for his work in Chopper (2000). In 2005, Bana co-starred with Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush in the political drama Munich (2005) directed by Steven Spielberg. In 1995, he began dating Rebecca Gleeson, a publicist and daughter of Australian High Court Chief Justice Murray Gleeson. The following year, he was named \"Bachelor of the Year\" by Cleo Magazine, and won a trip for two to the United States. He invited Gleeson, and proposed to her during that romantic trip. In 1997, the two were married; their son, Klaus, was born in 1999, their daughter, Sophia, was born in 2002. He currently resides in Melbourne with his wife and their two children. Bana is a passionate supporter of Australian football.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjcxMzI4OWItN2Y4NS00NDZjLWE3MDEtNTIwYWQyZjdiYjE2L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzAxOTAyMDc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051509","name":"Eric Bana","idIMDB":"nm0051509","born":"August 9, 1968 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","starSign":"Leo","starMeter":"53%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Dirty John","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt7945720"},{"title":"The Forgiven","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2249081"},{"title":"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1972591"},{"title":"Le Testament caché","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3344694"},{"title":"Special Correspondents","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4181052"},{"title":"The Finest Hours","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2025690"},{"title":"Deliver Us from Evil","year":" 2014/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2377322"},{"title":"Lone Survivor","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1091191"},{"title":"Closed Circuit","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2218003"},{"title":"Deadfall","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1667310"},{"title":"Hanna","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0993842"},{"title":"The Time Traveler's Wife","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0452694"},{"title":"Funny People","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1201167"},{"title":"Star Trek","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0796366"},{"title":"Mary et Max.","year":" 2009","remarks":["Damien (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0978762"},{"title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0467200"},{"title":"Romulus, My Father","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0462023"},{"title":"Lucky You","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0338216"},{"title":"Munich","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0408306"},{"title":"Troy","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0332452"},{"title":"Hulk","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Video Game)","Bruce Banner (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0352416"},{"title":"Hulk","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0286716"},{"title":"Finding Nemo","year":" 2003","remarks":["Anchor (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0266543"},{"title":"The Nugget","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0278597"},{"title":"Black Hawk Down","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0265086"},{"title":"Something in the Air","year":" 2000-2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0217960"},{"title":"Arctic Adventure","year":" 2000","remarks":["(Short)","Oz (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0766207"},{"title":"Chopper","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0221073"},{"title":"All Saints","year":" 1999-2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0163924"},{"title":"Eric","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0126157"},{"title":"Full Frontal","year":" 1993-1997","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0106006"},{"title":"Une maison de rêve","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118826"},{"title":"Eric","year":" 1996","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0115165"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"The Eric Bana Show Live","year":" 1997","remarks":["(TV Series)","(writer -

His family is of Irish origin. Gerard spent some of his very early childhood in Montreal, Quebec, but was mostly raised, along with his older brother and sister, in his hometown of Paisley. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his siblings were raised primarily by their mother, who later remarried. He had no contact with his father between the ages of two and 16 years old, after which time they became close. His father passed away when Gerard was in his early 20s. Butler went on to attend Glasgow University, where he studied to be a lawyer/solicitor. He was president of the school's law society thanks to his outgoing personality and great social skills. His acting career began when he was approached in a London coffee shop by actor Steven Berkoff, who later appeared alongside Butler in Attila (2001), who gave him a role in a stage production of \"Coriolanus\". After that, Butler decided to give up law for acting. He was cast as Ewan McGregor's character \"Renton\" in the stage adaptation of Trainspotting. His film debut was as Billy Connolly's younger brother in Mrs Brown (1997). While filming the movie in Scotland, he was enjoying a picnic with his mother near the River Tay when they heard the shouts of a young boy, who had been swimming with a friend, who was in some trouble. Butler jumped in and saved the young boy from drowning. He received a Certificate of Bravery from the Royal Humane Society. He felt he only did what anyone in the situation would have done. His film career continued with small roles, first in the \"James Bond\" movie, Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), and then Russell Mulcahy's Tale of the Mummy (1998). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being \"Attila the Hun\" in the USA Network mini-series, Attila (2001). The film's producers wanted a known actor to play the part but kept coming back to Butler's screen tests and decided he was their man. He had to lose the thick Scottish accent, but managed well. Around the time \"Attila\" was being filmed, casting was in progress for Wes Craven's new take on the \"Dracula\" legacy. Also wanting a known name, Butler wasn't much of a consideration, but his unending tenacity drove him to hounding the producers. Eventually, he sent them a clip of his portrayal of \"Attila\". Evidently, they saw something because Dracula 2000 (2000) was cast in the form of Butler. Attila's producers, thinking that his big-screen role might help with their own film's ratings, finished shooting a little early so he could get to work on Dracula 2000 (2000). Following these two roles, Butler developed quite a fan base, an Internet site and began appearing on lists everywhere. Since then, he has appeared in Reign of Fire (2002) as \"Creedy\" and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003) as \"Terry Sheridan\", alongside Angelina Jolie. The role that garnered him the most attention from both moviegoers and movie makers, alike, was that of \"Andre Marek\" in the big-screen adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel, Timeline (2003). Butler played an archaeologist who was sent back in time with a team of students to rescue a colleague. Last year, he appeared in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, The Phantom of the Opera (2004), playing the title character in the successful adaptation of the stage musical. It was a role that brought him much international attention. Other projects include Dear Frankie (2004), The Game of Their Lives (2005) and Beowulf, la légende viking (2005). In 2007, he starred as Spartan \"King Leonidas\" in the Warner Bros. production 300 (2006), based on the Frank Miller graphic novel, and Shattered (2007), co-starring Pierce Brosnan and Maria Bello, which aired on network TV under the title, \"Shattered\". He most recently starred in P.S. I Love You (2007), with Academy Award-winner Hilary Swank. In 2007, he appeared in Nim's Island (2008) and RocknRolla (2008), and completed the new Mark Neveldine / Brian Taylor film, Gamer (2009). His next films included The Ugly Truth (2009), co-starring Katherine Heigl, which began filming in April 2008, The Bounty Hunter (2010), How to Train Your Dragon (2010), Chasing Mavericks (2012) and Olympus Has Fallen (2013). Butler is also a relative of rising animator and film director Mark Flood.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NDMwMzc4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4Nzg4Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124930","name":"Gerard Butler","nicknames":["Gerry"],"idIMDB":"nm0124930","born":"November 13, 1969 in Paisley, Scotland, UK","starSign":"Scorpio","starMeter":"42%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Den of Thieves 2","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt8008948"},{"title":"Afterburn","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1210027"},{"title":"Naya Legend of the Golden Dolphin","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt7890826"},{"title":"Angel Has Fallen","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6189022"},{"title":"All-Star Weekend","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2461172"},{"title":"Keepers","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4131496"},{"title":"Hunter Killer","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1846589"},{"title":"Den of Thieves","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1259528"},{"title":"Geostorm","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1981128"},{"title":"A Family Man","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1718924"},{"title":"London Has Fallen","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3300542"},{"title":"Gods of Egypt","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2404233"},{"title":"How to Train Your Dragon 2","year":" 2014","remarks":["Stoick (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1646971"},{"title":"Olympus Has Fallen","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2302755"},{"title":"Movie 43","year":" 2013","remarks":["Leprechaun 1 & 2 (segment \"Happy Birthday\")"],"imdbid":"tt1333125"},{"title":"Playing for Keeps","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1540128"},{"title":"Chasing Mavericks","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1629757"},{"title":"Dragons: Gift of the Night Fury","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Video short)","Stoick the Vast (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2065968"},{"title":"Machine Gun Preacher","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1586752"},{"title":"Coriolanus","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1372686"},{"title":"Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Short)","Stoick (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1744776"},{"title":"Dreamworks How to Train Your Dragon Legends","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2542490"},{"title":"How to Train Your Dragon","year":" 2010","remarks":["Stoick (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0892769"},{"title":"The Bounty Hunter","year":" 2010/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1038919"},{"title":"Law Abiding Citizen","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1197624"},{"title":"Gamer","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1034032"},{"title":"The Ugly Truth","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1142988"},{"title":"Tales of the Black Freighter","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Video short)","The Sea Captain (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1295071"},{"title":"RocknRolla","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1032755"},{"title":"Nim's Island","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0410377"},{"title":"P.S.

She was born in Bermuda to parents from Yorkshire, England, where she was raised. She is the daughter John Headey, a police officer, and his wife Sue. Headey is best known for her role as \"Cersei Lannister\" in Game of Thrones (2011) (2011-present) and The Brothers Grimm (2005), Possession (2002), and The Remains of the Day (1993). Headey stars as \"Queen Gorgo\", a heroic Spartan woman in the period film, 300 (2006), by director Zack Snyder. Headey was born in Hamilton, Bermuda, to British parents Sue and John Headey. Her father, a Yorkshire police cadet, was sent to Bermuda shortly before her birth. She was raised there, living by the ocean until she was five. Back in England, she was brought up in Yorkshire before moving to London in her teens. Headey had not gone to drama school before she became an actress. At the age of 17, Headey's performance in a one-off show in the company of six school friends caught the attention of a casting agent, who took a photo and asked her to audition. Eventually, Headey was cast in Waterland (1992), which became her big-screen debut. She honed her natural acting talent while filming and also took archery classes and horse training. She also took boxing classes in clubs in south London, where a former boxer had been teaching her to spar. During her film career, spanning over 15 years, Headey has shown her range in a variety of roles, playing characters from Amazon-type warriors and action-minded women in The Cave (2005) and The Brothers Grimm (2005), to a lesbian florist in Imagine Me & You (2005). Headey's film career has taken her all over the world. She was in India for the filming of Le livre de la jungle (1994), then in St. Petersburg, Russia, for filming Onegin (1999), and in Norway for filming of Aberdeen (2000). In 2005 Headey was filming in Romania and in Mexico, then spent four months in Prague, Czech Republic, where a forest was designed and built for filming The Brothers Grimm (2005), with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. During 2006 Headey was in Canada for the filming of 300 (2006), then went to locations in Bulgaria for shooting The Contractor (2007), and Germany and in Czech Republic for the filming of Baron rouge (2008). She also played Gina McVey in the horror thriller The Broken (2008), and Elizabeth in Tell Tale (2009). In addition to her film-work, Heady appeared as Sarah Connor in a TV spin-off of the popular \"Terminator\" film franchise, the FOX's television series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008). Outside of her acting profession, Headey continued taking boxing lessons in London. She is a vegetarian and also remains loyal to yoga, which she discovered during her work in India. She has never been back to her birthplace in Bermuda; she shares her time between her homes in London, England, and Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwMjIwNjg0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI3MDEzMDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0372176","name":"Lena Headey","idIMDB":"nm0372176","born":"October 3, 1973 in Hamilton, Bermuda","starSign":"Libra","starMeter":"48%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Crooks","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt8169272"},{"title":"The Flood","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5954556"},{"title":"Fighting with My Family","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6513120"},{"title":"Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia","year":" 2017-2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1734135"},{"title":"Walk Like a Panther","year":" 2018","remarks":["Janet Winters (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt6962204"},{"title":"Danger Mouse","year":" 2015-2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4196822"},{"title":"ill Ray: the King","year":" 2017","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt7519612"},{"title":"Game of Thrones","year":" 2011-2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0944947"},{"title":"Uncle Grandpa","year":" 2014-2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3042608"},{"title":"Thumper","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5716380"},{"title":"Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV","year":" 2016","remarks":["Lunafreya Nox Fleuret (English version, voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5595168"},{"title":"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1374989"},{"title":"Zipper","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3346224"},{"title":"Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video Game)","Cersei Lannister (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3391176"},{"title":"300: Rise of an Empire","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1253863"},{"title":"Low Down","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1864405"},{"title":"The Adventurer: The Curse of the Midas Box","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1376213"},{"title":"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1538403"},{"title":"The Purge","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2184339"},{"title":"Dishonored","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video Game)","Callista Curnow (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2322244"},{"title":"Dredd","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1343727"},{"title":"White Collar","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1358522"},{"title":"Pete Smalls Is Dead","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1381413"},{"title":"The Super Hero Squad Show","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1388589"},{"title":"Risen","year":" 2009","remarks":["(Video Game)","Patty / Cathy / Jasmin / ...

(2006), The Young Victoria (2009), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and The Girl on the Train (2016), among many others. Blunt was born on February 23, 1983, in Roehampton, South West London, England, the second of four children in the family of Joanna Mackie, a former actress and teacher, and Oliver Simon Peter Blunt, a barrister. Her grandfather was Major General Peter Blunt, and her uncle is MP Crispin Blunt. Emily received a rigorous education at Ibstock Place School, a co-ed private school at Roehampton. However, young Emily Blunt had a stammer, since she was a kid of 8. Her mother took her to relaxation classes, which did not do anything. She reached a turning point at 12, when a teacher cleverly asked her to play a character with a different voice and said, \"I really believe in you\". Blunt ended up using a northern accent, and it did the trick, her stammer disappeared. From 1999 - 2001, Blunt went to Hurtwood House, the top co-ed boarding school where she would excel at sport, cello and singing. She also had two years of drama studies at Hurtwood's theatre course. In August 2000, she was chosen to perform at the Edinburgh Festival. She was signed up by an agent, Kenneth Mcreddie, who led her to the West End and the BBC, scoring her roles in several period dramas on stage as well as on TV productions, such as Foyle's War (2002), Henry VIII (2003) and Empire (2005). In 2001, she appeared as \"Gwen Cavendish\" opposite Dame Judi Dench in Sir Peter Hall's production of \"The Royal Family\" at Haymarket Theatre. For that role, she won the Evening Standard Award for Best Newcomer. In 2002, she played \"Juliet\" in \"Romeo and Juliet\" at the prestigious Chichester Festival. Blunt's career ascended to international fame after she starred as \"Isolda\" opposite Alex Kingston in Warrior Queen (2003). A year later, she won critical acclaim for her breakout performance as \"Tamsin\", a well-educated, cynical and deceptive 16-year-old beauty in My Summer of Love (2004), a story of two lonely girls from the opposite ends of the social heap. Emily Blunt and her co-star, Natalie Press, shared an Evening Standard British Film award for Most Promising Newcomer. In 2005, she spent a few months in Australia filming Irresistible (2006) with Susan Sarandon and Sam Neill. Blunt gave an impressive performance as \"Mara\", a cunning young destroyer who acts crazy and surreptitiously provokes paranoia in others. She also continued her work on British television, starring as \"Natasha\" in Stephen Poliakoff's Gideon's Daughter (2005), opposite Bill Nighy, a role that won her a 2007 Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role. She continued the line of playing manipulative characters as \"Emily\", a caustic put-upon assistant to Meryl Streep's lead in The Devil Wears Prada (2006). Blunt's performance with a neurotic twist added a dimension of sarcasm to the comedy, and gained her much attention as well as new jobs: in two dramas opposite Tom Hanks, then in the title role in the period drama, The Young Victoria (2009). Her most recent works include appearances as antiques dealer \"Gwen Conliffe\" in The Wolfman (2010) and as the ballerina in The Adjustment Bureau (2011). Emily is a highly versatile actress and a multifaceted person. Her talents include singing and playing cello; she is also skilled at horseback riding. On August 28, 2009, Blunt and Krasinski announced their engagement. The couple married on July 10, 2010, at the estate of their friend, George Clooney, on Lake Como in Italy. Blunt and Krasinski live in the Los Angeles area, California, and have two children.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNDY4MTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg5NzM2Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289434","name":"Emily Blunt","nicknames":["Em"],"idIMDB":"nm1289434","born":"February 23, 1983 in Roehampton, London, England, UK","starSign":"Pisces","starMeter":"69%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Jungle Cruise","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0870154"},{"title":"Mary Poppins Returns","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5028340"},{"title":"Sherlock Gnomes","year":" 2018","remarks":["Juliet (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2296777"},{"title":"A Quiet Place","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6644200"},{"title":"My Little Pony: The Movie","year":" 2017","remarks":["Tempest Shadow / Fizzlepop Berrytwist (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4131800"},{"title":"Animal Crackers","year":" 2017","remarks":["Zoe (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4155534"},{"title":"The Girl on the Train","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3631112"},{"title":"The Huntsman: Winter's War","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2381991"},{"title":"Sicario","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3397884"},{"title":"Into the Woods","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2180411"},{"title":"Edge of Tomorrow","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1631867"},{"title":"Le vent se lève","year":" 2013","remarks":["Nahoko Satomi (English version, voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2013293"},{"title":"Arthur Newman","year":" 2012","remarks":["Mike (Charlotte Fitzgerald)"],"imdbid":"tt1930546"},{"title":"Looper","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1276104"},{"title":"The Five-Year Engagement","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1195478"},{"title":"The Muppets","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1204342"},{"title":"Yves Saint Laurent: Opium","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt8421662"},{"title":"Your Sister's Sister","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1742336"},{"title":"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1441952"},{"title":"The Adjustment Bureau","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1385826"},{"title":"Gnomeo & Juliet","year":" 2011","remarks":["Juliet (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0377981"},{"title":"Gulliver's Travels","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1320261"},{"title":"Wild Target","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1235189"},{"title":"The Wolfman","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0780653"},{"title":"Curiosity","year":" 2009/I","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1347258"},{"title":"The Young Victoria","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0962736"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096697"},{"title":"Sunshine Cleaning","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0862846"},{"title":"The Great Buck Howard","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0460810"},{"title":"Charlie Wilson's War","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0472062"},{"title":"Dan in Real Life","year":" 2007/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0480242"},{"title":"The Jane Austen Book Club","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0866437"},{"title":"Wind Chill","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0486051"},{"title":"The Devil Wears Prada","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0458352"},{"title":"Irresistible","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0448564"},{"title":"Gideon's Daughter","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0487907"},{"title":"The Strange Case of Sherlock Holmes & Arthur Conan Doyle","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0470929"},{"title":"Empire","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0403759"},{"title":"My Summer of Love","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0382189"},{"title":"Poirot","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094525"},{"title":"Foyle's War","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0310455"},{"title":"Henry VIII","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0382737"},{"title":"Warrior Queen","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0338806"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"My Little Pony: The Movie","year":" 2017","remarks":["(performer: \"Open Up Your Eyes\")"],"imdbid":"tt4131800"},{"title":"Into the Woods","year":" 2014","remarks":["(performer: \"Prologue: Into the Woods\", \"The Cow as White as Milk\", \"A Very Nice Prince\", \"It Takes Two\", \"Any Moment\", \"Moments in the Woods\", \"Finale: Children Will Listen (Part 1)","\")"],"imdbid":"tt2180411"},{"title":"Wild Target","year":" 2010","remarks":["(performer: \"Happy Birthday to You\")"],"imdbid":"tt1235189"},{"title":"The Simpsons","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)","(performer -

From a very young age, he loved to learn, especially reading classical text in and outside the classroom. He took great attention to Irish play writers such as Samuel Beckett, which eventually led to him performing in his high school play production of \"Waiting for Godot\", and paying great attention to detail in his high school drama classes. Upon finishing 12th grade, he spent a couple of years with the Dublin Shakespeare Festival, and under the advice of a director there, headed across to London and auditioned for drama schools. Soon to follow, he was invited to audition for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford upon Avon, and spent a couple of seasons back in England on the stage. He then, at the age of thirty five, decided to audition for films in the UK and began to build a very respectable resume playing many different diverse characters. He made his debut as a quarryman in The Field (1990). He had several small roles in major Hollywood movies based in Ireland, such as Far and Away (1992) and Le cheval venu de la mer (1992). Memorably played historical Irish figure \"Michael Collins\" in The Treaty (1991). Made his breakthrough in Scottish themed Braveheart (1995), which was largely filmed in Ireland, opposite Mel Gibson. He played Gibson's right-hand man \"Hamish\". Since then, he has appeared in numerous major films such as Mission: Impossible II (2000), Lake Placid (1999), Turbulence (1997). He has made a name for himself taking the titular role in The General (1998), based on the life of Irish criminal \"Martin Cahill\", for which he won the Boston Society of Film Critics Award. He appears in director John Boorman's film The Tailor of Panama (2001) as well as Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002) and Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). Ever since, he has continued to bring his huge stage presence to the screen, always delivering the character in full development to his audience. He is married to his lovely wife, Mary, since 1982. They have four sons.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3NTMxODI0OTBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ1NTY5Mjc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322407","name":"Brendan Gleeson","idIMDB":"nm0322407","born":"March 29, 1955 in Dublin, Ireland","starSign":"Aries","starMeter":"43%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6412452"},{"title":"Mr. Mercedes","year":" 2017-2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4354880"},{"title":"Psychic","year":" 2018/II","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt7582452"},{"title":"Capitaine Morten et la reine des araignées","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2534642"},{"title":"Paddington 2","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4468740"},{"title":"Hampstead","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5153236"},{"title":"Assassin's Creed","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2094766"},{"title":"Live by Night","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2361317"},{"title":"Trespass Against Us","year":" 2016/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3305308"},{"title":"Alone in Berlin","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3026488"},{"title":"In the Heart of the Sea","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1390411"},{"title":"Suffragette","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3077214"},{"title":"Pursuit","year":" 2015/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4971424"},{"title":"The Money","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt3215778"},{"title":"Le chant de la mer","year":" 2014","remarks":["Conor / Mac Lir (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1865505"},{"title":"The Hogwarts Express","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3638848"},{"title":"Stonehearst Asylum","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1772264"},{"title":"Edge of Tomorrow","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1631867"},{"title":"Calvary","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2234003"},{"title":"1916 Seachtar Dearmadta","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3344708"},{"title":"The Grand Seduction","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2319580"},{"title":"The Smurfs 2","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2017020"},{"title":"Immaturity for Charity","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2656440"},{"title":"The Company You Keep","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1381404"},{"title":"So You Want to Be a Pirate!","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video short)","The Pirate with Gout (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2546400"},{"title":"The Pirates!

Paxton","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Bill Paxton was born on May 17, 1955 in Fort Worth, Texas. He was the son of Mary Lou (Gray) and John Lane Paxton, a businessman and actor (as John Paxton). Bill moved to Los Angeles, California at age eighteen, where he found work in the film industry as a set dresser for Roger Corman's New World Pictures. He made his film debut in the Corman film Crazy Mama (1975), directed by Jonathan Demme. Moving to New York, Paxton studied acting under Stella Adler at New York University. After landing a small role in Stripes (1981), he found steady work in low-budget films and television. He also directed, wrote and produced award-winning short films including Barnes & Barnes: Fish Heads (1980), which aired on Saturday Night Live (1975). His first appearance in a James Cameron film was a small role in The Terminator (1984), followed by his very memorable performance as Private Hudson in Aliens (1986) and as the nomadic vampire Severen in Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark (1987). Bill also appeared in John Hughes' Weird Science (1985), as Wyatt Donnelly's sadistic older brother Chet. Although he continued to work steadily in film and television, his big break did not come until his lead role in the critically acclaimed film-noir One False Move (1992). This quickly led to strong supporting roles as Wyatt Earp's naive younger brother Morgan in Tombstone (1993) and as Fred Haise, one of the three astronauts, in Apollo 13 (1995), as well as in James Cameron's offering True Lies (1994). Bill died on February 25, 2017, in Los Angeles, from complications following heart surgery. He was 61.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY2NTQwOTAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUyNjYwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000200","name":"Bill

Most recently, DuPois co-starred in the Pan African Film Festival's top prize-winning film, \"Ties That Bind,\" as well as in \"Duck\" with Phillip Baker Hall and the critically acclaimed film \"The Least Among You\" with Louis Gossett, Jr. Television audiences are well acquainted with DuPois from her growing list of series and Movie-of-the-Week guest appearances-including a recurring role on the runaway hit \"Lost\" with Harold Perrineau, \"Cold Case\" with Thom Barry, and \"K-Ville\" with Anthony Anderson. ABC's \"One Life to Live,\" \"The Road to Galveston,\" co-starring with Cicely Tyson, \"City of Angels\" \"Chicago Hope,\" \"The District,\" \"The Steve Harvey Show,\" \"Any Day Now,\" \"Through Hazel Eyes\" with Jane Seymour and HBO's acclaimed \"Strapped,\" and a stint as a series' regular on PBS' \"Up and Coming\" are among her many appearances. Her theatrical roots run deep with dozens of performances including the St. Louis Black Repertory Company productions of \"Intimate Apparel,\" \"Before It Hits Home,\" August Wilson's \"King Hedley II\"-all of which garnered prize nominations, as well as the coveted Woodie King, Jr. Award for her work as Best Actress in a Drama during the 2005-2006 season. Other notable highlights of her remarkable theatre career include \"The Mighty Gents\" for which she earned a Tony Award nomination and the Mark Taper Forum production of \"Miss Evers Boys\" (NAACP Image Award nomination). She also has the distinction of being the very rare performer to have portrayed all three female roles in Lorraine Hansberry's master work, \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" In addition to playing opposite Danny Glover in the landmark PBS production (earning the NAACP Image Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama), she recently received much acclaim for her show-stopping turn as Lena Younger in the Royal Exchange Theatre revival production held in Manchester, England. That performance earned her the Manchester Evening News Theater Award for Best Actress Award. Recently, she was awarded both the Eternity Award by the Los Angeles Women's Theater Festival and the Living Legend Award from the National Black Theatre Festival. DuPois' uncanny talent for capturing the essence of each character has carried her abroad to perform in Rome and Japan, leaving a trail of critical raves in her wake. Her portrayals of August Wilson's timeless characters in \"Fences,\" \"The Piano Lesson,\" (directed by Lloyd Richard and opposite Samuel L. Jackson and Charles S. Dutton) and \"Joe Turner's Come and Gone\" with Delroy Lindo, were nothing less than brilliant. A Philadelphia native, she holds M.F.A. in Theatre Arts from UCLA where she graduated magna cum laude. In addition to being involved in a myriad of civic and philanthropic endeavors, she mentors inspiring artists and serves as an adjunct professor in the Theatre Arts department of the University of Southern California. During off-season she can be found on tour with her highly successful one-woman show, \"Order My Steps.\" Ms. DuPois currently resides in Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwNDQ1ODIwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAyMzM5OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0210915","name":"Starletta

Scott Bumgarner","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Amiable and handsome James Garner had obtained success in both films and television, often playing variations of the charming anti-hero/con-man persona he first developed in Maverick, the offbeat western TV series that shot him to stardom in the late 1950s. James Garner was born James Scott Bumgarner in Norman, Oklahoma, to Mildred Scott (Meek) and Weldon Warren Bumgarner, a carpet layer. He dropped out of high school at 16 to join the Merchant Marines. He worked in a variety of jobs and received 2 Purple Hearts when he was wounded twice during the Korean War. He had his first chance to act when a friend got him a non-speaking role in the Broadway stage play \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial (1954)\". Part of his work was to read lines to the lead actors and he began to learn the craft of acting. This play led to small television roles, television commercials and eventually a contract with Warner Brothers. Director David Butler saw something in Garner and gave him all the attention he needed when he appeared in The Girl He Left Behind (1956). After co-starring in a handful of films during 1956-57, Warner Brothers gave Garner a co-starring role in the the western series Maverick (1957). Originally planned to alternate between Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) and Bret Maverick (Garner), the show quickly turned into the Bret Maverick Show. As Maverick, Garner was cool, good-natured, likable and always ready to use his wits to get him in or out of trouble. The series was highly successful, and Garner continued in it into 1960 when he left the series in a dispute over money. In the early 1960s Garner returned to films, often playing the same type of character he had played on \"Maverick\". His successful films included The Thrill of It All (1963), Move Over, Darling (1963), The Great Escape (1963) and The Americanization of Emily (1964). After that, his career wandered and when he appeared in the automobile racing movie Grand Prix (1966), he got the bug to race professionally. Soon, this ambition turned to supporting a racing team, not unlike what Paul Newman would do in later years. Garner found great success in the western comedy Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969). He tried to repeat his success with a sequel, Support Your Local Gunfighter (1971), but it wasn't up to the standards of the first one. After 11 years off the small screen, Garner returned to television in a role not unlike that in Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969). The show was Nichols (1971) and he played the sheriff who would try to solve all problems with his wits and without gun play. When the show was canceled, Garner took the news by having Nichols shot dead, never to return in a sequel. In 1974 he got the role for which he will probably be best remembered, as wry private eye Jim Rockford in the classic The Rockford Files (1974). This became his second major television hit, with Noah Beery Jr. and Stuart Margolin, and in 1977 he won an Emmy for his portrayal. However, a combination of injuries and the discovery that Universal Pictures' \"creative bookkeeping\" would not give him any of the huge profits the show generated soon soured him and the show ended in 1980. In the 1980s Garner appeared in few movies, but the ones he did make were darker than the likable Garner of old. These included Tank (1984) and Murphy's Romance (1985). For the latter, he was nominated for both the Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Returning to the western mode, he co-starred with the young Bruce Willis in Sunset (1988), a mythical story of Wyatt Earp, Tom Mix and 1920s Hollywood. In the 1990s Garner received rave reviews for his role in the acclaimed television movie about corporate greed, Barbarians at the Gate (1993). After that he appeared in the theatrical remake of his old television series, Maverick (1994), opposite Mel Gibson. Most of his appearances after that were in numerous TV movies based upon The Rockford Files (1974). His most recent films were My Fellow Americans (1996) and Space Cowboys (2000) .","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1Nzk2NTA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEzODI0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001258","name":"James Garner","nicknames":["Slick"],"idIMDB":"nm0001258","born":"April 7, 1928 in Norman, Oklahoma, USA","died":"July 19, 2014 (age 86) in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, USA","starSign":"Aries","starMeter":"59%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"DC Showcase Original Shorts Collection","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video)","Shazam (segment \"The Return of Black Adam\")","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1696202"},{"title":"Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video short)","Shazam (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1701223"},{"title":"First Night","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1110211"},{"title":"Battle for Terra","year":" 2007","remarks":["Doron (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0858486"},{"title":"The Ultimate Gift","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0482629"},{"title":"8 Simple Rules","year":" 2003-2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0312081"},{"title":"Al Roach: Private Insectigator","year":" 2004","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0428210"},{"title":"The Notebook","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0332280"},{"title":"The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Video)","Pat (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0378230"},{"title":"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0279778"},{"title":"First Monday","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0297560"},{"title":"Roughing It","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain)"],"imdbid":"tt0290280"},{"title":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","year":" 2001","remarks":["Rourke (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0230011"},{"title":"The Last Debate","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0249683"},{"title":"Space Cowboys","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0186566"},{"title":"God, the Devil and Bob","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0221751"},{"title":"Chicago Hope","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0108724"},{"title":"One Special Night","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0165543"},{"title":"Shake, Rattle and Roll: An American Love Story","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie)","Audience Member (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0206507"},{"title":"The Rockford Files: If It Bleeds...

However, he spent most of the next decade in television, regularly appearing in Combat! (1962), The Virginian (1962), Gunsmoke (1955) and 12 O'Clock High (1964). Skerritt's next big break was appearing alongside Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould in Robert Altman's biting satire MASH (1970). Several other film roles quickly followed, before he landed the plum role of Capt. Dallas of the ill-fated commercial towing vehicle Nostromo in the creepy sci-fi epic Alien (1979). Skerritt turned up again in another thriller playing a cop hunting a serial killer in the eerie The Dead Zone (1983), as a Navy Officer Flight instructor in Top Gun (1986) , in the six-chick flick Steel Magnolias (1989), and then as the poster boy for a \"Guess\" Jeans ad campaign utilizing his mature, weather-beaten features. Skerritt didn't neglect his TV background and reappeared on the small screen in Cheers (1982), The China Lake Murders (1990) and picked up an Emmy in 1994 for his performance as Sheriff Brock in the superb series Picket Fences (1992). Skerritt has remained continually busy for the past decade, contributing natural, entertaining and reliable performances in TV series, made-for-TV movies and major theatrical releases. He recreated the role of Will Kane in the TV production of High Noon (2000), and appeared alongside Bruce Willis in the mercenary war drama Tears of the Sun (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY3Mjk5MTMyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjUxMTc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000643","name":"Tom

Cartwright","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Born in Bristol, England, Veronica is the older sister of the popular child actress Angela Cartwright. In her early career, Veronica was cast in a number of popular movies such as The Children's Hour (1961), Spencer's Mountain (1963) and Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963). As such, she was cast as \"Jemima Boone\" in the popular television series Daniel Boone (1964), which ran from 1964 to 66. Her career after \"Daniel Boone\" may have been influenced by Hitchcock, since she appeared in both the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and the horror classic Alien (1979). On television, she appeared twice as Lumpy's younger sister, \"Violet Rutherford\" and once as \"Peggy MacIntosh\" on Leave It to Beaver (1957) and had a small role in the television movie Still the Beaver (1983). Cartwright also appeared in Robert Kennedy and His Times (1985), Tanner '88 (1988) and had a recurring role on L.A. Law (1986). Her big screen features included The Right Stuff (1983), Flight of the Navigator (1986) and The Witches of Eastwick (1987). Veronica worked on the stage in \"Electra\", \"Talley's Folly\", \"Homesteaders\", \"Butterflies are Free\" and \"The Triplet Connection\". Alternating between television and big screen movies in the 90s, Cartwright has appeared in such films as Hitler's Daughter (1990) and Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NDE0MDkyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI1MzUyMDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001021","name":"Veronica

Stanton was born in West Irvine, Kentucky, to Ersel (Moberly), a cook, and Sheridan Harry Stanton, a barber and tobacco farmer. Stanton served as a cook in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and was on board an LST during the Battle of Okinawa. He then returned to the University of Kentucky to appear in a production of \"Pygmalion\", before heading out to California and honing his craft at the prestigious Pasadena Playhouse. Stanton then toured around the United States with a male choir, worked in children's theater, and then headed back to California. His first role on screen was in the tepid movie Tomahawk Trail (1957), but he was quickly noticed and appeared regularly in minor roles as cowboys and soldiers through the late 1950s and early 1960s. His star continued to rise and he received better roles in which he could showcase his laid-back style, such as in Cool Hand Luke (1967), Kelly's Heroes (1970), Dillinger (1973), The Godfather: Part II (1974), and in Alien (1979). It was around this time that Stanton came to the attention of director Wim Wenders, who cast him in his finest role yet as Travis in the moving Paris, Texas (1984). Next indie director Alex Cox gave Stanton a role that really brought him to the forefront, in the quirky cult film Repo Man (1984). Stanton was now heavily in demand, and his unique look got him cast as everything from a suburban father in the mainstream Pretty in Pink (1986) to a soft-hearted, but ill-fated, private investigator in Wild at Heart (1990) and a crazy yet cunning scientist in Escape from New York (1981). Apart from his film performances, Stanton is also an accomplished musician, and \"The Harry Dean Stanton Band\" and their unique spin on mariachi music have been playing together for well over a decade. They have toured internationally to rave reviews. Stanton became a cult figure of cinema and music and when Debbie Harry sang the lyric \"I want to dance with Harry Dean...\" in her 1990s hit \"I Want That Man\", she was talking about him. As he moved into the time in his life when most other people would be calling it a day, Harry Dean Stanton has remained consistently active on screen, most recently appearing in films including Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), The Green Mile (1999) and The Man Who Cried (2000). A true gem amongst character actors, and with an on screen presence capable of adding that something extra to any production.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMDYyMTQ2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjU2NjE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001765","name":"Harry Dean Stanton","idIMDB":"nm0001765","born":"July 14, 1926 in West Irvine, Kentucky, USA","died":"September 15, 2017 (age 91) in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA","starSign":"Cancer","starMeter":"52%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Frank and Ava","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5963314"},{"title":"Twin Peaks","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4093826"},{"title":"Lucky","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5859238"},{"title":"Sick of it All","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4152212"},{"title":"Hux","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt4778586"},{"title":"Getting On","year":" 2013-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2342652"},{"title":"The Pimp and the Rose","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3840518"},{"title":"Alien: Isolation","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video Game)","Brett (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3391132"},{"title":"The Killers Feat.

His mother's family, originally surnamed \"Fraga\", was entirely Portuguese, while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a \"fractured\" family. He moved around a great deal after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started. Ron Howard was working on Splash (1984), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy Dragnet (1987), Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Big (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in A League of Their Own (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and then with Philadelphia (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation. In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay. Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. Hanks' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film Toy Story (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy That Thing You Do! (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwNDA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA2NDY3NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158","name":"Tom Hanks","idIMDB":"nm0000158","born":"July 9, 1956 in Concord, California, USA","starSign":"Cancer","starMeter":"41%","filmographies":[{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"Lewis and Clark","year":" ","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)","(executive producer - 6 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt0485843"},{"title":"A Man Called Ove","year":" ","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt7405458"},{"title":"Beautiful","year":" ","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt4545774"},{"title":"No Better Place to Die","year":" 2019","remarks":["(executive producer)"],"imdbid":"tt2170533"},{"title":"Greyhound","year":" 2019","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt6048922"},{"title":"The 2000s","year":" 2018","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)","(executive producer - 7 episodes)"],"imdbid":"tt8651972"},{"title":"Mamma Mia!

Dick. His father, a real estate salesman, was killed in a collision with a drunk driver while driving his family home from a University of Colorado football game, when Tim was eleven years old. His mother, a community service worker, remarried her high school sweetheart, an Episcopalian deacon, two years after Tim's father's death. He was raised with his many siblings and step-siblings. When Tim was young, his family moved to Birmingham, Michigan. In high school, his favorite subject was shop, of course, and after high school, he attended Western Michigan University and graduated with a degree in Television Production in 1975. In 1978, he was arrested on drug charges and spent two years in jail. Upon his release, he had a new outlook on life and on a dare from a friend, started his comedy career at the Comedy Castle in Detroit. Later, he went on to do several cable specials, including, Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen (1988) and Tim Allen: Men Are Pigs (1990). In 1991, he became the star of his own hit television series on ABC called Home Improvement (1991).

After the Golden Era of Hollywood ended, Don Rickles was, until early 2017, one man still living to tell his tales. One of the most respected talents in entertainment, Rickles got his start in the night clubs, toiling for over 20 years, until 1958, when Don made his film debut in Run Silent Run Deep (1958). The movie was a big hit. Afterward, Rickles continued acting, starring in films like X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (1963), Bikini Beach (1964), Enter Laughing (1967), and Kelly's Heroes (1970). In 1973, Don became a regular on Dean Martin's Celebrity Roasts. From 1973 until 1984, Don appeared frequently on Dean's show, paying tribute to some of his friends, like Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball, and was even the roast master on the roast for Dean Martin himself. In 1976, Don his own TV series CPO Sharkey (1976), which enjoyed a two year run. After 1984, Don began taking it easy, appearing in a few minor film roles. But in 1995, Don made a big comeback, appearing with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen in Toy Story (1995) in the role of the grouchy Mr. Potato Head. In 1999, he returned as Mr. Potato Head in Toy Story 2 (1999).

Lucas' film career began by accident in 1979 when a small Canadian film production shot on the tiny coastal South Carolina Island, Sullivan's Island, where Lucas and his family lived. Unbeknownst to the filmmakers, 8 year old Lucas was hiding in the sand dunes watching filming during the climatic scene where teenage lovers engage in a lovesick fight. It was during this experience that Lucas decided to pursue a career in film which he has now done for nearly 3 decades. Born to young radical politically active parents in Arkansas in 1971, Lucas spent his early childhood nomadically moving around the southern U.S. The family finally settled in Gig Harbor, Washington, where Lucas attended high school. The school had an award winning drama/debate program and Lucas won the State Championship in Dramatic Interpretation and competed at the 1989 National Championship. Brief stints in professional theater in Seattle followed before Lucas moved to Los Angeles. After receiving breaks playing a young George Armstrong Custer in the Steven Spielberg produced Class of '61 (1993) and Frank Marshall's film Alive (1993), Lucas' career toiled in minor TV appearances. Frustrated, he decided to start over and relocated to New York City. In NYC, Lucas studied acting for years under Suzanne Shepherd and worked in smaller theater productions like Shakespeare in the Parking Lot before receiving another break in 1997 when he was cast as Judas in Terrence McNally's controversial off-Broadway production Corpus Christi. The play led to his being cast in the films You Can Count on Me (2000) and American Psycho (2000). These films were followed by interesting performances in the Oscar-winning A Beautiful Mind (2001) and the box office hit Sweet Home Alabama (2002). Lucas has since worked with many of the film community's greatest talents. He starred alongside Jon Voight in Jerry Bruckheimer's Glory Road (2006), for which Lucas added 40 pounds to transform himself into legendary basketball coach Don Haskins. Lucas also starred with Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss in Wolfgang Petersen's Poseidon (2006). He starred with Morgan Freeman and Robert Redford in Lasse Hallström's Une vie inachevée (2005). He also starred opposite Jamie Bell in David Gordon Green's Undertow (2004), which was also produced by Terrence Malick. Additionally, Lucas worked alongside Christopher Walken in Around the Bend (2004). He performed with Jennifer Connelly and Eric Bana in Ang Lee's Hulk (2003). Other credits include Wonderland (2003), The Deep End (2001), American Psycho (2000), Session 9 (2001) and You Can Count on Me (2000). Lucas' theater credits include the off-Broadway run of \"Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell\"; Tennessee Williams' \"The Glass Menagerie\", which appeared on Broadway in 2005; Terrence McNally's \"Corpus Christi\" at the Manhattan Theater Club; Christopher Shinn's \"What Didn't Happen\"; and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". Lucas has always been fascinated by documentaries and performed voice work with film legend Ken Burns on the documentary The War (2007), and also provided voice-over work for Operation Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience (2007), Trumbo (2007) and Resolved (2007). Lucas' first venture into production was Stolen (2009), in which he played the single father of a mentally challenged boy. The film was the first project to be produced through Lucas' production company, \"Two Bridges\". In the past few years, Lucas' films include The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), Daydream Nation (2010), Peacock (2010), as Charles Lindbergh in Clint Eastwood's film J. Edgar (2011), and the massive Australian box office and critical success Red Dog (2011), for which Lucas won Australia's best actor award (The I.F. Award). He also played Beat generation legend Neal Cassady in Big Sur (2013). He can be seen in Kevin Connolly's Dear Eleanor (2016), the upcoming Sundance festival film Little Accidents and the NY indie film The Mend.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjgwOGQ2NmEtNzJhYy00YThkLTliNTUtZTdmMGY4NGJkNWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzYwNzUyOTM@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524197","name":"Josh Lucas","idIMDB":"nm0524197","born":"June 20, 1971 in Fayetteville, Arkansas, USA","starSign":"Gemini","starMeter":"52%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Ford v.

Damon","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Matthew Paige Damon was born on October 8, 1970, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Kent Damon, a stockbroker, realtor and tax preparer, and Nancy Carlsson-Paige, an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother, Kyle, a sculptor. His father was of English and Scottish descent, and his mother is of Finnish and Swedish ancestry. The family lived in Newton until his parents divorced in 1973, when Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community, and was raised near actor Ben Affleck. Damon attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. He attended Harvard University as an English major. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, Rising Sun (1993), and prep-school drama, School Ties (1992). It was until his film, Geronimo: An American Legend (1993), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely. Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, Mystic Pizza (1988). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in School Ties (1992). Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, Courage Under Fire (1996). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for Good Will Hunting (1997), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. Good Will Hunting (1997) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with Ben Affleck. In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in Steven Spielberg's film, Saving Private Ryan (1998), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with Tom Hanks and Vin Diesel while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in Rounders (1998), starring opposite Edward Norton and John Malkovich. The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, Ben Affleck and fellow comedian, Chris Rock, in the comedy Dogma (1999). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played \"Tom Ripley\", a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow also starred in the movie. The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance. Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, Titan A.E. (2000) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, All the Pretty Horses (2000) and the golf comedy-drama, The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000), starring alongside Will Smith. In the year 2003, he signed on to star in The Informant! (2009) by Steven Soderbergh and the Farrelly Brothers' Stuck on You (2003). He also starred in Gerry (2002), a film he co-wrote with his friends, Gus Van Sant and Casey Affleck. One of Matt's most recognizable work to date is his role in the \"Bourne\" movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, \"Jason Bourne\", in The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). Another praised role is that as \"Linus Caldwell\" in the \"Ocean's\" movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle in Ocean's Eleven (2001). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007). Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt has been a part of are Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm (2005), George Clooney's Syriana (2005), Martin Scorsese's The Departed (2006) and Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006). In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born Luciana Barroso, whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana's daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella.

His mother, Chris Anne (née Boldt), is a school teacher, and his father, Timothy Byers Affleck, is a social worker; the two are divorced. Ben has a younger brother, actor Casey Affleck, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, Géza, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor. Affleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series, The Voyage of the Mimi (1984). It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor, Matt Damon. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including Hands of a Stranger (1987) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988). He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in Dazed and Confused (1993). After that, he did mostly independent films like Kevin Smith's Mallrats (1995) and Chasing Amy (1997) which were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for Good Will Hunting (1997), they gave it to their agent, Patrick Whitesell, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend Kevin Smith who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997, Good Will Hunting (1997) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly. Affleck chose such roles in the blockbusters Armageddon (1998), Shakespeare in Love (1998), and Pearl Harbor (2001). In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits Changing Lanes (2002), The Sum of All Fears (2002), and Daredevil (2003), as well as the disappointing comedies Gigli (2003) and Surviving Christmas (2004). While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Hollywoodland (2006). In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films Smokin' Aces (2006), Ce que pensent les hommes (2009), State of Play (2009), and Extract (2009). He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller Gone Baby Gone (2007), which starred his brother, Casey Affleck, and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in The Town (2010), which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller Argo (2012), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck's second Oscar win). In 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller Gone Girl (2014). He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), briefly reprised the character in Suicide Squad (2016), and did so again in Justice League (2017). Affleck married actress Jennifer Garner in 2005. The couple has three children. In June 2015, Affleck and Garner separated, and in April 2017 they filed for divorce.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MzIxMTk0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU5NjA0Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255","name":"Ben

He became a star in his teens through the title role in the TV-series Bombi Bitt och jag (1968). Between the years 1972-88 he was employed at The Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, where he participated in \"Vita rum\" (1988), August Strindberg's \"Ett drömspel\" (1986) and \"Mäster Olof\" (1988). Simultaneously Skarsgård did outstanding film roles, notably in The Simple-Minded Murderer (1982) by Hans Alfredson and with Fred Ward in American Playhouse: Noon Wine (1985). The fantastic performance gave him both a well-earned Guldbagge and Silver Berlin Bear. He portrayed the Skagen-painter Sören Kröyer in Hip Hip Hurrah! (1987) and the Swedish ambassador Raoul Wallenberg in Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg (1990), both directed by Kjell Grede. Täcknamn Coq Rouge (1989) and Den demokratiske terroristen (1992) he played Jan Guillou's Swedish superagent Carl Hamilton. He also had the leading part in the Oscar nominated Oxen (1991) directed by the world-famous cinematographer Sven Nykvist. Skarsgård did his first (but small) role in an big American film with The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988). The role of Captain Tupolev in The Hunt for Red October (1990) was at supposed to be biggest part in a Hollywood-film, but unfortunately it was cut down. His breakthrough instead came with Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves (1996) opposite newcomer Emily Watson. After that Skarsgård got several supporting roles in American films, such as in My Son the Fanatic (1997), Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting (1997) and Steven Spielberg's Amistad (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NDUzOTY0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYxODE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001745","name":"Stellan Skarsgård","nicknames":["Skarzie"],"idIMDB":"nm0001745","born":"June 13, 1951 in Gothenburg, Västra Götalands län, Sweden","starSign":"Gemini","starMeter":"42%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Chernobyl","year":" 2019","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt7366338"},{"title":"Out Stealing Horses","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt7319496"},{"title":"The Painted Bird","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1667354"},{"title":"Music, War and Love","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5070062"},{"title":"The Breath's Deer","year":" 2018","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt8787570"},{"title":"Mamma Mia!

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is congressman Mike Capuano. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister, Carly Evans, and two younger siblings, a brother named Scott Evans, who is also an actor, and a sister named Shana Evans. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. On the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on The Fugitive (2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring Harrison Ford. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in Cherry Falls (2000) and The Newcomers (2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in Boston Public (2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature, Not Another Teen Movie (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen. After filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful - Just Married (2003) and Eastwick (2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy, The Perfect Score (2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller, Cellular (2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress, Cellular (2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four (2005), 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies. The year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance. The Nanny Diaries (2007), where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie Street Kings (2008), playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond (2008).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTg1OTQzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIyMjkyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635","name":"Chris Evans","nicknames":["Cevans"],"idIMDB":"nm0262635","born":"June 13, 1981 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA","starSign":"Gemini","starMeter":"64%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Greenland","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt7737786"},{"title":"Jekyll","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5697510"},{"title":"Untitled Avengers Movie","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4154796"},{"title":"The Red Sea Diving Resort","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6675186"},{"title":"Avengers: Infinity War","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4154756"},{"title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2250912"},{"title":"Gifted","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4481414"},{"title":"Captain America: Civil War","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3498820"},{"title":"Ant-Man","year":" 2015","remarks":["Steve Rogers (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0478970"},{"title":"Avengers: Age of Ultron","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2395427"},{"title":"Playing It Cool","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2139555"},{"title":"Before We Go","year":" 2014/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0443465"},{"title":"Captain America: The Winter Soldier","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1843866"},{"title":"Thor: The Dark World","year":" 2013","remarks":["Loki as Captain America (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1981115"},{"title":"Snowpiercer -

Her mother, Melanie Sloan, is from a Jewish family from the Bronx, and her father, Karsten Johansson, is a Danish-born architect, from Copenhagen. She has a sister, Vanessa Johansson, who is also an actress, a brother, Adrian, a twin brother, Hunter Johansson, born three minutes after her, and a paternal half-brother, Christian. Her grandfather was writer Ejner Johansson. Johansson began acting during childhood, after her mother started taking her to auditions. She made her professional acting debut at the age of eight in the off-Broadway production of \"Sophistry\" with Ethan Hawke, at New York's Playwrights Horizons. She would audition for commercials but took rejection so hard her mother began limiting her to film tryouts. She made her film debut at the age of nine, as John Ritter's character's daughter in the fantasy comedy North (1994). Following minor roles in Just Cause (1995), as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw's character, and If Lucy Fell (1996), she played the role of Amanda in Manny & Lo (1996). Her performance in Manny & Lo garnered a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female, and positive reviews, one noting, \"[the film] grows on you, largely because of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson\", while San Francisco Chronicle critic Mick LaSalle commentated on her \"peaceful aura\", and wrote, \"If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed, she could become an important actress.\". After appearing in minor roles in Fall (1997) and Home Alone 3 (1997), Johansson garnered widely spread attention for her performance in The Horse Whisperer (1998), directed by Robert Redford, where she played Grace MacLean, a teenager traumatized by a riding accident. She received a nomination for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress for the film. In 1999, she appeared in My Brother the Pig (1999) and in the music video for Mandy Moore's single, \"Candy\". Although the film was not a box office success, she received praise for her breakout role in Ghost World (2001), credited with \"sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age\". She was also featured in the Coen Brothers' dark drama The Man Who Wasn't There (2001), opposite Billy Bob Thornton and Frances McDormand. She appeared in the horror comedy Eight Legged Freaks (2002) with David Arquette and Kari Wuhrer. In 2003, she was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, one for drama (Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003)) and one for comedy (Lost in Translation (2003)), her breakout role, starring opposite Bill Murray, and receiving rave reviews and a Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival. Her film roles include the critically acclaimed Weitz brothers' film In Good Company (2004), as well as starring opposite John Travolta in A Love Song for Bobby Long (2004), which garnered her a third Golden Globe Award nomination. She dropped out of Mission: Impossible III (2006) due to scheduling conflicts. Her next film role was in The Island (2005) alongside Ewan McGregor which earned weak reviews from U.S. critics. After this, she appeared in Woody Allen's Match Point (2005) and was nominated again for a Golden Globe Award. In May 2008, she released her album \"Anywhere I Lay My Head\", a collection of Tom Waits covers featuring one original song. Also that year, she starred in Frank Miller's The Spirit (2008), the Woody Allen film Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), and played Mary Boleyn opposite Natalie Portman in The Other Boleyn Girl (2008). Since then, she has appeared as part of an ensemble cast in the romantic comedy Ce que pensent les hommes (2009), the action superhero film Iron Man 2 (2010), the comedy-drama We Bought a Zoo (2011) and started as the original scream queen, Janet Leigh, in Hitchcock (2012). She then played her character, Black Widow, in the blockbuster action films The Avengers (2012), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), and Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and also headlined the science-fiction thriller Lucy (2014), a box office success. With more than a decade of work already under her belt, Scarlett has proven to be one of Hollywood's most talented young actresses. Her 2017 roles are the sci-fi action thriller Ghost in the Shell (2017) and the dark comedy Rough Night (2017). Scarlett and Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds were engaged in May 2008 and married in September of that year. In 2010, the couple announced their separation, and subsequently divorced a year later. In 2013, she became engaged to French journalist Romain Dauriac, the couple married a year later. In January 2017, the couple announced their separation, and subsequently divorced in March of that year. They have a daughter, Rose Dorothy Dauriac (born

His brothers are actors Liam Hemsworth and Luke Hemsworth. He is of Dutch (from his immigrant maternal grandfather), Irish, English, Scottish, and German ancestry. His uncle, by marriage, was Rod Ansell, the bushman who inspired the film Crocodile Dundee (1986). Chris saw quite a bit of the country in his youth, after his family moved to the Northern Territory before finally settling on Phillip Island, to the south of Melbourne. In 2004, he unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Robbie Hunter in the Australian soap opera Summer Bay (1988) but was recalled for the role of Kim Hyde which he played until 2007. In 2006, he entered the Australian version of Dancing with the Stars (2004) and his popularity in the soap enabled him to hang on until show 7 (Dancing with the Stars: Episode #5.7 (2006) when he became the fifth contestant to be eliminated. His first Hollywood appearance was in Star Trek (2009), but it was his titular role in Thor (2011) which propelled him to prominence worldwide. He reprised the character in the science fiction blockbuster The Avengers (2012). Chris's American representative, management company ROAR, also manages actress Elsa Pataky, and it was through them that the two met, marrying in 2010. The couple have a daughter and twin sons.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU2MTI0NTIyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA4Nzc3OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1165110","name":"Chris Hemsworth","nicknames":["Kip"],"idIMDB":"nm1165110","born":"August 11, 1983 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","starSign":"Leo","starMeter":"66%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Untitled Star Trek Sequel","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4756228"},{"title":"Untitled Men in Black Spin-Off","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2283336"},{"title":"Untitled Avengers Movie","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4154796"},{"title":"Bad Times at the El Royale","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6628394"},{"title":"Avengers: Infinity War","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4154756"},{"title":"Tourism Australia: Dundee -

His paternal grandparents were from the Isle of Man and Ireland, respectively. He lives with his parents and three younger brothers - Paddy and twins Sam and Harry. Tom attended Donhead Prep School. Then, after a successful eleven plus exam, he became a pupil at Wimbledon College. Having successfully completed his GCSEs, in September 2012 Tom started a two-year course in the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology notable for its numerous famous alumni. Holland began dancing at a hip hop class at Nifty Feet Dance School in Wimbledon, London. His potential was spotted by choreographer Lynne Page (who was an Associate to Peter Darling, choreographer of Billy Elliot and Billy Elliot the Musical) when he performed with his dance school as part of the Richmond Dance Festival 2006. After eight auditions and subsequent two years of training, on 28 June 2008 Tom made his West End debut in Billy Elliot the Musical as Michael, Billy's best friend. He gave his first performance in the title role of Billy on 8 September 2008 getting rave reviews praising his versatile acting and dancing skills. In September 2008 Tom (together with co-star Tanner Pflueger) appeared on the news programme on channel FIVE and gave his first TV interview. In 2009 Tom was featured on ITV1 show \"The Feel Good Factor\". At the launch show on 31 January he and two other Billy Elliots, Tanner Pflueger and Layton Williams, performed a specially choreographered version of Angry Dance from Billy Elliot the Musical, after which Tom was interviewed by host Myleene Klass. Then he became involved into training five ordinary British schoolboys learning to get fit and preparing their dance routine (fronted by Tom) for the final \"The Feel Good Factor\" show on 28 March 2009. On 11 March 2010, Tom, along with fellow Billy Elliots Dean-Charles Chapman and Fox Jackson-Keen appeared on The Alan Titchmarsh Show on ITV1. On 8 March 2010, to mark the fifth anniversary of Billy Elliot the Musical, four current Billy Elliots, including Tom Holland, were invited to 10 Downing Street to meet the Prime Minister Gordon Brown. It was Tom Holland who was chosen to be a lead at the special fifth anniversary show on 31 March 2010. Elton John, Billy Elliot the Musical composer, who was at the audience, called Tom's performance \"astonishing\" and said that he was \"blown away\" by it. Holland had been appearing on a regular basis as Billy in Billy Elliot the Musical rotating with three other performers till 29 May 2010 when he finished his run in the musical. In two months after leaving Billy Elliot the Musical, Holland successfully auditioned for a starring role in the film The Impossible (directed by Juan Antonio Bayona) alongside Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. The Impossible was based on a true story that took place during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012, and was released in Europe in October 2012, and in North America in December 2012. Tom has received universal praise for his performance, in particular: \"What a debut, too, from Tom Holland as the eldest of their three lads\" (The Telegraph); \"Tom Holland, making one of the finest feature debuts in years\" (HeyUGuys); \"the excellent Tom Holland\" (The Guardian); \"The child performers are uncanny and there is an especially terrific performance from Tom Holland as the resourceful, levelheaded Lucas terrified but tenacious in the face of an unspeakable ordeal\" (Screen Daily); \"Young Holland in particular is astonishingly good as the terrified but courageous Lucas.\" (The Hollywood Reporter); \"However, the real acting standout in The Impossible is the performance of Tom Holland as the eldest son Lucas. His portrayal is genuine, and at no moment does it feel melodramatic and forced. The majority of his scenes are separate from the lead actors and for the most part it feels like The Impossible is Holland's film\" (Entertainment Maven); \"Mr. Holland, meanwhile, matures before our eyes, navigating the passage from adolescent self-absorption to profound and terrible responsibility. He is a terrific young actor\" (New York Times). Tom has given a number of interviews about his role in The Impossible. In particular, he talked on video to Vanity Fair Senior West Coast editor Krista Smith and with IAMROGUE's Managing Editor Jami Philbrick. He has also given interviews to The Hollywood Reporter, to the MovieWeb, to Today Show on NBC and to other outlets. Tom's director and co-stars have also talked about him. Juan Antonio Bayona: \"He had this extraordinary ability to get into the emotion and portray it in a very, very easy way. The best I'd ever seen in a kid.\" Ewan McGregor: \"It was wonderful watching Tom who had never worked in front of a camera before, to see him really get it and grow as a film actor as he went along. He's really talented and polite to everyone. It's very easy for children to lose perspective but he's absolutely on the right road and a brilliant actor.\" Naomi Watts: \"He has an incredible emotional instrument and an unbelievable sense of himself... Tom Holland and I had a couple of moments where we came together and I could just tell how wonderful he was and what a beautiful instrument he had. It was just easy to work with him, that was one of the greatest highlights for me: discovering a friendship with Tom off-screen and this beautiful relationship between mother and son on-screen. The intimacy that develops through the course of the film between Lucas and Maria, I just loved that relationship. I mean, Tom is a beyond gifted actor. He's just a raw, open talent that is just so easy to work with. And Tom, he's inspiring, he kind of lifts everyone's game around him because he can do nothing but tell the truth. He was great.\" In his turn, Tom Holland has returned favours to Naomi Watts when he was asked to present Desert Palm Achievement Award to her at Palm Springs International Film Festival. According to HitFix: \"One recurring theme of the night was how the introductions were often better than actual winner's speeches... The best intro, however, had to go to 16-year-old Tom Holland who intro'd his \"Impossible\" co-star Watts. Holland admitted of all of Watts' great performances his dad had only let him see \"King Kong\" and while they spent six weeks shooting in a water tank he didn't know it was \"difficult\" because he actually \"loved it\"... Most important, this was Holland's first film role and he sweetly noted, \"From the moment I met you, you took my hand and you never let go.\" Cue the \"awwww\" from the audience.\" The presentation is available on video. In 2011, Holland was cast in British version of the animation film Arrietty, produced by Japan's cult Studio Ghibli. He has provided voice over for the principal character Sho. In 2012 Tom Holland played the starring role of Isaac in the film \"How I lived Now\", (directed by Kevin Macdonald) alongside Saoirse Ronan. The film was released in 2013. On 17 October 2012, Holland became a recipient of Hollywood Spotlight Award for his role in The Impossible. \"We are very excited that we will be able to recognize acting talents that are on the road to discovery and stardom,\" said Carlos de Abreu, founder and executive director of the Hollywood Film Awards in a statement. On 6 December 2012 it was announced that Holland became a winner of the National Board of Review award in the \"Breakthrough Actor\" category. In the end of December 2012, Holland was voted a winner for the year's Best Youth Performance in Nevada Critics Awards. In December 2012, Holland received a number of nominations for his role in The Impossible: for the 18th annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards, in the \"Best Young Acror/Acress\" category; for Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the \"Most Promising Performer\" category; for the 27th Goya Awards in the \"Best New Actor\" category; for the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the \"Best Youth Performance\" category; for the London Film Critics Circle Awards 2012 in the \"Young British Performer of the Year\" category. Kristopher Tapley, Editor-at-Large of HitFix, reported on 27 August 2012 that Summit Entertainment, the company responsible for distribution of The Impossible in USA, would be campaigning Holland rather than McGregor as the lead, and strongly argued that Tom Holland deserved to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Actor category. The fact of long-listing for an Academy Award was confirmed in the article in the Hollywood Reporter: \"And though McGregor stars as his father in the film, Holland has been submitted as the lead actor for awards consideration. Regardless if he receives any nominations, his performance as the strong-willed and determined eldest son is garnering critical acclaim.\" As one of the most promising young actors, Holland was featured in Screen International's \"UK Stars of Tomorrow - 2012\" and in Variety's \"Youth Impact Report 2012\". Holland has been signed up by William Morris Endeavor (WME) global talent agency and is represented by Curtis Brown literary and talent agency. In 2015, Tom was cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in Sony and Marvel's films. He has played the role in Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), and Avengers: Infinity War (2018).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAzMzA3NjQwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzODQ5MTI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4043618","name":"Tom Holland","idIMDB":"nm4043618","born":"June 1, 1996 in Kingston upon Thames, England, UK","starSign":"Gemini","starMeter":"47%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Uncharted","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1464335"},{"title":"Spies in Disguise","year":" 2019","remarks":["Walter Beckett (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5814534"},{"title":"Spider-Man: Far From Home","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6320628"},{"title":"The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle","year":" 2019","remarks":["Jip (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt6673612"},{"title":"Chaos Walking","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2076822"},{"title":"Avengers: Infinity War","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4154756"},{"title":"The Current War","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2140507"},{"title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2250912"},{"title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming, NBA Finals: Watch the Game","year":" 2017","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt7006122"},{"title":"Pilgrimage","year":" 2017/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3531202"},{"title":"The Lost City of Z","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1212428"},{"title":"Escapade fatale","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4526546"},{"title":"Captain America: Civil War","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3498820"},{"title":"In the Heart of the Sea","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1390411"},{"title":"Tweet","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt5969758"},{"title":"Wolf Hall","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3556920"},{"title":"Billy Elliot","year":" 2014","remarks":["Former Billy (Encore)","(uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt4085696"},{"title":"How I Live Now","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1894476"},{"title":"Locke","year":" 2013","remarks":["Eddie (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2692904"},{"title":"Moments","year":" 2013/VI","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3359412"},{"title":"The Impossible","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1649419"},{"title":"The Secret World of Arrietty","year":" 2010","remarks":["Shô (UK version, voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1568921"}]},{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Tweet","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt5969758"}]},{"section":"Miscellaneous Crew","filmography":[{"title":"A Monster Calls","year":" 2016","remarks":["(stand-in: The Monster)"],"imdbid":"tt3416532"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"A Monster Calls","year":" 2016","remarks":["(thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt3416532"},{"title":"Too High, Too Far, Too Soon","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Short)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt5887150"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"The IMDb Show","year":" 2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt7549864"},{"title":"Entertainment Tonight","year":" 2017-2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0081857"},{"title":"Dagsrevyen","year":" 2018","remarks":["(TV Series)","Himself -

He played further comedic roles in Mr. Mom (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984), and Beetlejuice (1988), earned further acclaim for his dramatic portrayal of Bruce Wayne / Batman in Tim Burton's Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), and since then, has moved easily between film genres, ranging from drama and romantic comedy to thriller and action. Keaton was born Michael John Douglas on September 5, 1951 in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, to Leona Elizabeth (Loftus), a homemaker, and George A. Douglas, a civil engineer and surveyor. He is of Irish, as well as English, Scottish, and German, descent. Michael studied speech for two years at Kent State, before dropping out and moving to Pittsburgh. An unsuccessful attempt at stand-up comedy led Keaton to working as a TV cameraman in a cable station, and he came to realize he wanted to work in front of the cameras. Keaton first appeared on TV in several episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1968). He left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for TV. He began cropping up in popular TV shows including Maude (1972) and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour (1979). Around this time, Keaton decided to use an alternative surname to remove confusion with better-known actor Michael Douglas. After reading an article on actress Diane Keaton, he decided that Michael Keaton sounded good. His next break was scoring a co-starring role alongside Jim Belushi in the short-lived comedy series Working Stiffs (1979), which showcased his comedic talent and led to his co-starring role in Night Shift (1982). Keaton next scored the lead in the comedy hits Mr. Mom (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984) , Gung Ho (1986), the Tim Burton horror-comedy Beetlejuice (1988), and The Dream Team (1989). Keaton's career was given another major boost when he was again cast by Tim Burton, this time as the title comic book superhero, millionaire playboy / crime-fighter Bruce Wayne, in Batman (1989). Burton cast him because he thought that Keaton was the only actor who could portray someone who has the kind of darkly obsessive personality that the character demands. To say there were howls of protest by fans of the caped crusader comic strip is an understatement! Warner Bros. was deluged with thousands of letters of complaint commenting that comedian Keaton was the wrong choice for the Caped Crusader, given his prior work and the fact that he lacked the suave, handsome features and tall, muscular physicality often attributed to the character in the comic books. However, their fears were proven wrong when Keaton turned in a sensational performance, and he held his own on screen with opponent Jack Nicholson, playing the lunatic villain, \"The Joker\". Keaton's dramatic work earned widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and Batman (1989) became one of the most successful films of the year. Keaton remained active during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films. Keen to diversify his work, Keaton starred as a psychotic tenant in Pacific Heights (1990), as a hard-working cop in One Good Cop (1991), and then donned the black cape and cowl once more for Batman Returns (1992). He remained in demand during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films, including the star-studded Shakespearian Much Ado About Nothing (1993), the drama My Life (1993), another Ron Howard comedy The Paper (1994), with sexy Andie MacDowell in Multiplicity (1996), twice in the same role, dogged Elmore Leonard character Agent Ray Nicolette, in Jackie Brown (1997) and Out of Sight (1998). He also played a killer in the mediocre thriller Desperate Measures (1998). In the 2000s, Keaton appeared in several productions with mixed success, including Live from Baghdad (2002), First Daughter (2004), and Herbie Fully Loaded (2005). He also provided voices for characters in the animated films Cars (2006), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Minions (2015). He returned to major film roles in the 2010s, co-starring in The Other Guys (2010), RoboCop (2014) and Need for Speed (2014). Also that year, Keaton starred alongside Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014), a film by 21 Grams (2003) and Biutiful (2010) director Alejandro G. Iñárritu. In the film, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a screen actor, famous for playing the iconic titular superhero, who puts on a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver short story, to regain his former glory. Keaton's critically praised lead performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, the Critics' Choice Award for Best Actor and Best Actor in a Comedy, and nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award, British Academy Film Award, and Academy Award for Best Actor. In 2015, he played a journalist in Spotlight (2015), which, like Birdman, won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2016, he starred as Ray Kroc, the developer of McDonald's, in the drama The Founder (2016). He is a visiting scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NTE2MzczOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTM4MjYz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000474","name":"Michael

Marisa has a brother, actor Adam Tomei. As a child, Marisa's mother frequently corrected her speech as to eliminate her heavy Brooklyn accent. As a teen, Marisa attended Edward R. Murrow High School and graduated in the class of 1982. She was one year into her college education at Boston University when she dropped out for a co-starring role on the CBS daytime drama As the World Turns (1956). Her role on that show paved the way for her entrance into film: in 1984, she made her film debut with a bit part in The Flamingo Kid (1984). Three years later, Marisa became known for her role as Maggie Lawton, Lisa Bonet's college roommate, on the sitcom A Different World (1987). Her real breakthrough came in 1992, when she co-starred as Joe Pesci's hilariously foul-mouthed, scene-stealing girlfriend in My Cousin Vinny (1992), a performance that won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Later that year, she turned up briefly as a snippy Mabel Normand in director Richard Attenborough's biopic Chaplin (1992), and was soon given her first starring role in Untamed Heart (1993). A subsequent starring role -- and attempted makeover into Audrey Hepburn -- in the romantic comedy Only You (1994) proved only moderately successful. Marisa's other 1994 role as Michael Keaton's hugely pregnant wife in The Paper (1994) was well-received, although the film as a whole was not. Fortunately for Tomei, she was able to rebound the following year with a solid performance as a troubled single mother in Nick Cassavetes' Décroche les étoiles (1996) which earned her a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She turned in a similarly strong work in Welcome to Sarajevo (1997), and in 1998 did some of her best work in years as the sexually liberated, unhinged cousin of Natasha Lyonne's Vivian Abramowitz in Tamara Jenkins' Slums of Beverly Hills (1998). Marisa co-starred with Mel Gibson in the hugely successful romantic comedy What Women Want (2000) and during the 2002 movie award season, she proved her first Best Supporting Actress Oscar win was no fluke when she received her second nomination in the same category for the critically acclaimed dark drama, In the Bedroom (2001). She also made a guest appearance on the animated TV phenomenon The Simpsons (1989) as Sara Sloane, a movie star who falls in love with Ned Flanders. In 2006, she went on to do 4 episodes for Rescue Me (2004). She played Angie, the ex-wife of Tommy Calvin (Denis Leary)'s brother Johnny (Dean Winters). At age 42, Marisa took on a provocative role in legendary filmmaker Sidney Lumet's melodramatic picture Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007), in which she appeared nude in love scenes with costars Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Marisa then took on another provocative role as a stripper in the highly acclaimed film The Wrestler (2008) opposite Mickey Rourke. Her great performance earned her many awards from numerous film societies for Best Supporting Actress, a third Academy Award nomination, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe and a BAFTA. Many critics heralded this performance as a standout in her career.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjA3OTc3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA1MzY1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000673","name":"Marisa

Her parents divorced in 1950 and her mother then married stuntman Jock Mahoney, and they had a daughter, Princess O'Mahoney. She also has a brother, Richard Field. Sally attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, California. Her acting career began in 1965, when she landed the role of Frances Elizabeth 'Gidget' Lawrence in Gidget (1965); it was canceled after only one season because of bad ratings. She went on to star in The Flying Nun (1967), which ran for three seasons. She also appeared in her first film in 1967, The Way West (1967) opposite Kirk Douglas. In the next few years she appeared in numerous TV movies and TV shows such as Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring (1971), Marriage: Year One (1971), The Girl with Something Extra (1973), and Sybil (1976). In 1977 she starred alongside then-boyfriend Burt Reynolds in the box office hit Smokey and the Bandit (1977), which led to a less successful sequel in 1980. In 1979 she starred in the popular film Norma Rae (1979) and she received her first Oscar for that role. In the years that followed she starred in films such as Absence of Malice (1981), Kiss Me Goodbye (1982), Places in the Heart (1984) (she received her second Oscar for her role), Murphy's Romance (1985), Punchline (1988) and Steel Magnolias (1989). In 1993 she starred alongside Robin Williams and Pierce Brosnan in the popular comedy Mrs. Doubtfire (1993). A year after, she played the role of Tom Hanks character's mother (even though she's only ten years older than he is in real life) in the film Forrest Gump (1994). The film was a huge commercial success and won six Academy awards. Since then she has appeared in TV movies and miniseries such as A Woman of Independent Means (1995), Merry Christmas, George Bailey (1997), From the Earth to the Moon (1998) and David Copperfield (2000). In 2000 she appeared in the film Where the Heart Is (2000) with Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd, and in 2003 she starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde (2003). She also appeared in 12 episodes of ER (1994) from 2000 to 2006. In recent years she has played the role of matriarch Nora Walker in the hit television show Brothers & Sisters (2006), which earned her an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2007. Sally has been married twice, first to Steven Craig from 1968 to 1973. They had two sons together, Peter Craig and Eli Craig. Her second marriage was to film producer Alan Greisman from 1984 to 1994. They had one son together, Samuel Greisman. Between marriages, from 1976 to 1980, she was in a relationship with Burt Reynolds.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwOTMyMDI4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDYzMTM5OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000398","name":"Sally

He is the son of Tim and Linda Whitehead, and has two sisters, Maisie and Hattie, and a younger brother, Sonny. Maisie, the eldest of the four, is a dancer and an Aerialist-Yoga enthusiast, while Hattie is a folk artist who has released a folk album. Named after Irish folk legend Fionn mac Cumhaill, Whitehead grew up in an artistic environment, much due to the fact that his father, Tim Whitehead, is an acclaimed British jazz musician who, having a law degree from Manchester University, decided to pursue music instead. He had a long and varied career as a jazz composer, performer and teacher. Tim has played extensively throughout the UK and Europe, and more recently in the USA with American pianist Phil DeGreg. In the '70s, he toured with Ian Carr's Nucleus and Graham Collier Music, and won the Young Jazz Musicians of the Year Award with his own band, South of the Border, in 1977. Fionn began acting at the Orange Tree Theatre when he was thirteen years old, then went to Orleans Park School where he was among of the top lads, awarded 12 passes at A* or A. Upon finishing school Fionn went to Richmond College and entered the National Youth Theatre's summer course. By 2015, he was an aspiring actor who worked at a coffee shop in Waterloo, London. He starred in the 2016 British miniseries the ITV three-part series HIM while continuing to be an active member of the Youth Theatre. He also acted in a stage performance of Glenn Waldron's Natives and is one of Screen International's Stars of Tomorrow 2016. The year 2017 marked big for Fionn Whitehead, as the 19-year-old (Born in 1997) English actor was cast as the lead for Christopher Nolan's British historical epic Dunkirk alongside many of his well established all country mates. Nolan compared Whitehead to \"a young\" Tom Courtenay. In 2017 Fionn will star as the lead role in Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk and has just finished shooting the young lead in the feature The Children Act opposite actress Emma Thompson and actor Stanley Tucci. He is represented by the Curtis Brown Agency and according to Deadline, Whitehead has signed with UTA for agency representation by Curtis Brown and Peikoff Mahan.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxZDA4OWQtYmFlZS00YjUxLTk4NTItZWYwYmFjMjFkYmZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjkzNzIyODI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7887725","name":"Fionn

He was a member of various local drama groups from about age 12. He left school at age 15 to work as a junior reporter on a local paper; he quit when his editor told him he was spending too much time at the theatre and not enough working. Stewart spent a year as a furniture salesman, saving cash to attend drama school. He was accepted by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 1957. He made his professional debut in 1959 in the repertory theatre in Lincoln; he worked at the Manchester Library Theatre and a tour around the world with the Old Vic Company followed in the early 1960s. Stewart joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1966, to begin his 27-year association. Following a spell with the Royal National Theatre in the mid 1980s, he went to Los Angeles, California to star on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), which ran from 1987-1994, playing the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. After the series ended, Stewart reprised his role for a string of successful Star Trek films: Star Trek: Generations (1994), Star Trek: First Contact (1996), Star Trek: Insurrection (1998), and Star Trek: Nemesis (2002). Stewart continues to work on the stage and in various films. He was awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in the 2010 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzU5ODQ5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODIwODk1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001772","name":"Patrick Stewart","nicknames":["Old

In 2017 he starred in the film Logan alongside Hugh Jackman.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NTIwMTE5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUxODgwNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2933542","name":"Boyd Holbrook","idIMDB":"nm2933542","born":"September 1, 1981 in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, USA","starSign":"Virgo","starMeter":"55%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"In the Shadow of the Moon","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt8110640"},{"title":"Drop City","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6070924"},{"title":"The Ghost of Kelly Pavlik","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt7642076"},{"title":"Two/One","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3842684"},{"title":"The Predator","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3829266"},{"title":"O.G.","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt7897102"},{"title":"Boomtown","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4616802"},{"title":"Logan","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3315342"},{"title":"Cardboard Boxer","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3230660"},{"title":"Narcos","year":" 2015-2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2707408"},{"title":"Morgan","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4520364"},{"title":"The Free World","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3517044"},{"title":"Jane Got a Gun","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2140037"},{"title":"Run All Night","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2199571"},{"title":"Gone Girl","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2267998"},{"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0365907"},{"title":"Little Accidents","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3125220"},{"title":"The Skeleton Twins","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1571249"},{"title":"Out of the Furnace","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1206543"},{"title":"Behind the Candelabra","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1291580"},{"title":"The Host","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1517260"},{"title":"Very Good Girls","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1931602"},{"title":"Hatfields & McCoys","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1985443"},{"title":"The Magic of Belle Isle","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1839654"},{"title":"Moving Takahashi","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2070748"},{"title":"The Reunion","year":" 2011/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1792543"},{"title":"The Big C","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1515193"},{"title":"The Oranges","year":" 2011","remarks":["Circle (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt1313139"},{"title":"Higher Ground","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1562568"},{"title":"Tough Trade","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1553691"},{"title":"The Beautiful Life: TBL","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1400580"},{"title":"The Unusuals","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1240976"},{"title":"Milk","year":" 2008/I","remarks":["Denton Smith (as Robert Boyd Holbrook)"],"imdbid":"tt1013753"}]},{"section":"Writer","filmography":[{"title":"Peacock Killer","year":" 2015/I","remarks":["(Short)","(writer)"],"imdbid":"tt3568222"}]},{"section":"Producer","filmography":[{"title":"O.G.","year":" 2018","remarks":["(producer)"],"imdbid":"tt7897102"}]},{"section":"Director","filmography":[{"title":"Peacock Killer","year":" 2015/I","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3568222"}]},{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Higher Ground","year":" 2011","remarks":["(performer: \"Sea of Nevermore\", \"Hair On My Chest\")"],"imdbid":"tt1562568"}]},{"section":"Thanks","filmography":[{"title":"A Look Behind the Tombstones","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video documentary short)","(special thanks)"],"imdbid":"tt5500860"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Making 'Logan'","year":" 2017","remarks":["(Video documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt7178282"},{"title":"Made in Hollywood","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0911896"},{"title":"Good Morning America","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0072506"},{"title":"Harry","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt6002946"},{"title":"Liam Neeson: Action All Night","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt5425018"},{"title":"Run All Night: Shoot All Night","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt5425000"},{"title":"A Look Behind the Tombstones","year":" 2015","remarks":["(Video documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt5500860"}]}]},{"birthName":"Walter Bruce Willis","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Actor and musician Bruce Willis is well known for playing wisecracking or hard-edged characters, often in spectacular action films. Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD, placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts. Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene K. (from Kassel), and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly \"discovered\" whilst working in a café in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role. After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye \"David Addison\" alongside sultry Cybill Shepherd in the hit romantic comedy television series Moonlighting (1985). The series firmly established Bruce Willis as a hot new talent, and his sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. was in effect a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective \"John McClane\" in the monster hit Die Hard (1988). This superbly paced action film balanced laconic humor and wholesale destruction as Willis' character single handedly battles a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Willis reprized the role of tough guy cop \"John McClane\" in the eagerly anticipated sequel Die Hard 2 (1990) set at snowbound Washington's Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995) this time also starring Samuel L. Jackson as a cynical Harlem shopowner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in NYC. Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice of \"Mikey\" the baby in the very popular family comedies Look Who's Talking (1989), and its sequel Look Who's Talking Too (1990) also starring John Travolta and Kirstie Alley. Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) and Hudson Hawk (1991) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyperviolent The Last Boy Scout (1991), the darkly humored Death Becomes Her (1992) and the mediocre police thriller Striking Distance (1993). During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing North (1994), as a cagey prizefighter in the Quentin Tarantino directed mega-hit Pulp Fiction (1994), the Terry Gilliam directed apocalyptic thriller Twelve Monkeys (1995), the Luc Besson directed sci-fi opus The Fifth Element (1997) and the M. Night Shyamalan directed spine-tingling epic The Sixth Sense (1999). Willis next starred in the gangster comedy The Whole Nine Yards (2000), worked again with \"hot\" director M. Night Shyamalan in the less gripping Unbreakable (2000), and in two military dramas, Hart's War (2002) and Tears of the Sun (2003) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically applauded Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie Sin City (2005), the voice of \"RJ\" the scheming raccoon in the animated hit Over the Hedge (2006) and \"Die Hard\" fans rejoiced to see \"John McClane\" return to the big screen in the high tech Live Free or Die Hard (2007) aka \"Die Hard 4.0\". Willis was married to actress Demi Moore for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three daughters.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MjMzMTE5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ2ODE3Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246","name":"Bruce Willis","nicknames":["Bruno"],"idIMDB":"nm0000246","born":"March 19, 1955 in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany","starSign":"Pisces","starMeter":"66%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Die Hard: Year One","year":" ","remarks":["John McClane (rumored)"],"imdbid":"tt5117432"},{"title":"10 Minutes Gone","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt8809652"},{"title":"Cornerman","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6470096"},{"title":"Motherless Brooklyn","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0385887"},{"title":"Glass","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6823368"},{"title":"Air Strike","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4743226"},{"title":"Reprisal","year":" 2018/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6547170"},{"title":"Death Wish","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1137450"},{"title":"Acts of Violence","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6684714"},{"title":"First Kill","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5884234"},{"title":"Once Upon a Time in Venice","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4694544"},{"title":"Split","year":" 2016/IX","remarks":["David Dunn (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt4972582"},{"title":"Marauders","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3963816"},{"title":"Precious Cargo","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4651410"},{"title":"Extraction","year":" 2015/II","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4382872"},{"title":"Rock the Kasbah","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3164256"},{"title":"Vice","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3480796"},{"title":"The Prince","year":" 2014/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1085492"},{"title":"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0458481"},{"title":"Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video Game)","John McClane (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4916238"},{"title":"RED 2","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1821694"},{"title":"G.I.

Trained in ballet, her parents guided all of the children at one time or another into acting (which included Christopher (Kit), Terry and Candace Culkin). Bonnie herself attended Quintano School for Young Professionals in New York at one point and Bonnie and Kit went on to appear on the local stage and TV. Brother Kit would later be known more for siring a handful of talented child actors and/or stars (Macaulay Culkin, Kieran Culkin, and the rest). It was Bonnie who was first spotted among the other acting siblings by a talent scout who happened to catch her in a school production of \"Tom Sawyer\", and encouraged her. She made her professional debut at age 9 in a 1957 North Jersey Playhouse production of \"Dr. Praetorius\" and then was handed a full scholarship to study at George Balanchine's New York City Ballet. But the acting bug had bitten and after dancing in only four productions (including playing the role of Clara in \"The Nutcracker\"), she decided to hang up her ballet slippers. She proceeded to study at both the HB Studio and Actors Studio in New York. Bonnie nabbed a five-year role as young teen \"Sandy Porter\" in the New York-based daytime soap Love of Life (1951) starting in 1961. During that time, she took her first Broadway bow in \"Isle of Children\", a show that lasted but a week in March of 1962. She was also a replacement in the established hit comedy \"Enter Laughing\", a year later. After appearing in the stage play \"The Playroom\" in 1965, she earned strong reviews for her touching performance in \"My Sweet Charlie\", for which she won the 1967 Theatre World Award for \"promising new artist\". In it, she played a pregnant young Southern girl on the lam with a black lawyer. Patty Duke recreated the role a few years later on TV and captured an Emmy. Films beckoned at this point and Bonnie made her debut lending topnotch support in The Gypsy Moths (1969) which reunited From Here to Eternity (1953) stars Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr. She earned even better marks in her next two films, one performance simply haunting and the other one hilarious. Once again playing pregnant and once again delivering a touching pathos, she played the dirt-poor marathon dancer who pitches songs for pennies and the almost-mother of Bruce Dern's child in the superb, award-winning, Depression-era drama They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969). On the other end of the acting spectrum, she played the lovable bride-to-be in the side-splitting comedy classic Lovers and Other Strangers (1970). By this time, Bonnie had started concentrating on family values. She married scriptwriter Ken Luber on April 24, 1969, and bore him a son, Yuri, the following year. The time off to focus on motherhood (she had second son, Jonah Luber, in 1976) proved detrimental to her rising star. The remaining decade was uneventful at best, despite some fine showings in a splattering of TV-movies. Her big comeback came again on the movie trail in the early 1980s when she absolutely nailed the role of race car driver Shirley Muldowney in Heart Like a Wheel (1983). She was surprisingly overlooked at Oscar time, however, despite the praise she received. Despite respected work in subsequent movies such as Violets Are Blue... (1986), The Prince of Pennsylvania (1988), Presumed Innocent (1990) and a running role as Bruce Willis's put-upon wife in Die Hard (1988) and its sequel, she found better and more frequent parts on TV. She found her niche in TV-movies with social themes and tugged at more hearts in Switched at Birth (1991), A Mother's Right: The Elizabeth Morgan Story (1992), Any Mother's Son (1997) and To Live Again (1998). In a change of pace, Bonnie joined the ensemble cast of the low-budget cult comedy Sordid Lives (2000), as \"Latrelle\", a homophobic woman dealing with her mother's death, the imprisonment of her gay brother and her own son's \"coming out\". The movie has recently evolved into a TV series, which is scheduled for some time in 2008 and reunites her with original cast members Leslie Jordan and Olivia Newton-John. Divorced from the father of her two children, she is presently married to third husband (or fourth, depending on your source of reference) actor Michael MacRae, whom she married in 1995.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzEyOTA4MTM5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ4NTQzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000889","name":"Bonnie

He made a name for himself portraying these unlikeable characters. A native of Jersey City, New Jersey, Gleason studied extensively at the Actor's Studio in New York City in the mid-60s with Lee Strasberg (his mentor) and was seen in a handful of Roger Corman productions before landing a a three-year role on the TV soap opera All My Children (1970). He appeared in over 60 films, with key roles in Trading Places (1983), Die Hard (1988), Miami Blues (1990), Boiling Point (1993) and Van Wilder: Party Liaison (2002). However, he is perhaps best remembered for his role as the no-nonsense principal \"Richard Vernon\" in The Breakfast Club (1985). He also guest-starred in numerous television series, including Hill Street Blues (1981), Dawson's Creek (1998) and Friends (1994). Gleason passed away of mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer at a Burbank, California hospital on May 29th 2006 at the age of

Breaking that rule did him no harm, though, as he achieved pop cult status by finding, fighting and blowing up a 25-foot-long Great White shark (nicknamed \"Bruce\") in the mega-hit Jaws (1975) and then electrocuting an even bigger Great White in the vastly inferior Jaws 2 (1978). Athletic Scheider was born in November 1932 in Orange, New Jersey, to Anna (Crosson) and Roy Bernhard Scheider, a mechanic. He was of German and Irish descent. A keen sportsman from a young age, he competed in baseball and boxing (his awkwardly mended broken nose is a result of his foray into Golden Gloves competitions). While at college, his pursuits turned from sports to theater and he studied drama at Rutgers and Franklin and Marshall. After a stint in the military, Scheider appeared with the New York Shakespeare Festival and won an \"Obie Award\" for his appearance in the play \"Stephen D.\" His film career commenced with the campy Z-grade horror cheesefest The Curse of the Living Corpse (1964), and he then showed up in Star! (1968), Paper Lion (1968), Stiletto (1969) and Puzzle of a Downfall Child (1970). In 1971 he really came to the attention of film audiences with his role in the Jane Fonda thriller Klute (1971) and then as Det. Buddy Russo (scoring his first Oscar nomination) alongside fiery Gene Hackman in the crime drama The French Connection (1971). His performance as a tough street cop in that film led him into another tough cop role as NYC Det. Buddy Manucci in the underappreciated The Seven-Ups (1973), which features one of the best car chase sequences ever put on film. In the early 1970s the Peter Benchley novel \"Jaws\" was a phenomenal best-seller, and young director Steven Spielberg was chosen by Universal Pictures to direct the film adaptation, Jaws (1975), in which Scheider played police chief Brody and shared lead billing with Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss in the tale of a New England seaside community terrorized by a hungry Great White shark. \"Jaws\" was a blockbuster, and for many years held the record as the highest-grossing film of all time. Scheider then turned up as the shady CIA agent brother of Dustin Hoffman in the unnerving Marathon Man (1976) and in the misfired William Friedkin-directed remake of The Wages of Fear (1953) titled Sorcerer (1977), before again returning to Amity to battle another giant shark in Jaws 2 (1978). Seeking a change from tough cops and hungry sharks, he took the role of womanizing, drug-popping choreographer Joe Gideon, the lead character of the semi-autobiographical portrayal of director Bob Fosse in the sparkling All That Jazz (1979). It was another big hit for Scheider (and another Oscar nomination), with the film featuring a stunning opening sequence to the tune of the funky George Benson number \"On Broadway\", and breathtaking dance routines including the \"Airotica\" performance by the glamorous Sandahl Bergman. Returning to another law enforcement role, Scheider played a rebellious helicopter pilot in the John Badham conspiracy / action film Blue Thunder (1983), a scientist in the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) simply titled 2010 (1984), a cheating husband who turns the tables on his blackmailers in 52 Pick-Up (1986), a cold-blooded hit man in Cohen and Tate (1988) and a CIA operative in the muddled and slow-moving The Russia House (1990). The versatile Scheider was then cast as the captain of a futuristic submarine in the relatively popular TV series SeaQuest 2032 (1993), which ran for three seasons. Inexplicably, however, Scheider had seemingly, and slowly, dropped out of favor with mainstream film audiences, and while he continued to remain busy, predominantly in supporting roles (generally as US presidents or military officers), most of the vehicles he appeared in were B-grade political thrillers such as État d'urgence (1997), Executive Target (1997), Chain of Command (2000) and Red Serpent (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODY5ODg4OTdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDUzOTM3Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001702","name":"Roy

His paternal grandfather was Scottish, from Argyll. Shaw's mother, who was born in Piggs Peak, Swaziland, met his father while she was a nurse at a hospital in Truro, Cornwall. His father was an alcoholic and a manic depressive; he committed suicide when Robert was only 12. He had three sisters--Elisabeth, Joanna and Wendy--and one brother, Alexander. As a boy, he attended school in Truro and was quite an athlete, competing in rugby, squash and track events but turned down an offer for a scholarship at 17 to go to London, with further education in Cambridge, as he did not want a career in medicine but, luckily for the rest of us, in acting. He was also inspired by one of the schoolmasters, Cyril Wilkes, who got him to read just about everything, including all of the classics. Wilkes would take three or four of the boys to London to see plays. The first play Robert would ever see was \"Hamlet\" in 1944 with Sir John Gielgud at the Haymarket. Robert went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts with a £1,000 inheritance from his grandmother. He went on from the Academy, after two years (1946-1948) to Stratford-on-Avon, where he was directed by Gielgud, who said to Shaw, \"I do admire you and think you've got a lot of ability, and I'd like to help you, but you make me so nervous.\" He then went on to make his professional stage debut in 1949 and tour Australia in the same year with the Old Vic. He had joined the Old Vic at the invitation of Tyrone Guthrie, who had directed him as the Duke of Suffolk in \"Henry VIII\" at Stratford. He played nothing but lesser Shakespearean roles, Cassio in \"Othello\" and Lysander in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and toured Europe and South Africa with the company. Shaw was sold on Shakespeare and thought that it would be his theatrical life at that stage. He was discovered while performing in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" in 1950 at Stratford by Sir Alec Guinness, who suggested he come to London to do Hamlet with him. He then went on to his first film role, a very small part in the classic The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) with Guinness but a start nonetheless. It was also at this time that he married his first wife, Jennifer Bourne, an actress he had met while working at the Old Vic, and married her in Sallsbury, South Rhodesia, on August 1, 1952. Together they would have four daughters: Deborah, Penny, Rachel and Katherine. He would also appear briefly in The Dam Busters (1955) and did the London production of \"Tiger at the Gates\" in June 1955 as Topman. He would also make \"Hill in Korea\" around that time and then, after taking on several jobs as a struggling actor and to support his growing family, he would be cast as Dan Tempest in The Buccaneers (1956). Shaw did not take his role seriously but made £10,000 for eight months' work. It was around that time that he wrote his first novel, \"The Hiding Place.\" It was a success, selling 12,000 copies in England and about the same in France and in the United States. He also wrote a dramatization of it that was produced on commercial television in England, and Playhouse 90 (1956) aired a different dramatization in America. Around 1959, he became involved with well-known actress Mary Ure, who was married to actor John Osborne at the time. He slipped her his telephone number one night at 3 a.m. while visiting the couple, and she called him the next day. It was around then, in 1960, that Robert Shaw became a reporter for England's Queen magazine and covered the Olympics in Rome. Shaw and Ure acted together in Middleton's The Changeling at the Royal Court Theatre in London in 1961. He was playing the part of an ugly servant in love with the mistress of the house, who persuades him to murder her fiance. Shaw and Ure had a child on August 31 even though they were still married to their other spouses. His wife, Jennifer, and Ure had children of his only weeks apart from each other. Ure divorced Osborne and married Shaw in April 1963. The couple was often quoted by the press as being \"very much in love,\" and they would have four children together: Colin, Elizabeth, Hannah and Ian. That same year, after making the next two films, Alerte sur le Vaillant (1962) and The Guest (1963), he made From Russia with Love (1963) and was unforgettable as blond assassin, Donald 'Red' Grant. He also made Tomorrow at Ten (1963), as well as a TV version of Hamlet as Claudius. He would then film The Luck of Ginger Coffey (1964) with Ure and then star in Battle of the Bulge (1965) as German Panzer commander Hessler. He wrote \"The Flag\" on the set of the film. He was nominated for his next role, as Henry VIII in A Man for All Seasons (1966), an outstanding, unequal lead performance. He would write his fourth novel \"The Man in the Glass Booth,\" which was later made into a play with Donald Pleasence and later into a film with Maximilian Schell. In 1967, he again starred with his wife in Custer of the West (1967) and went on to The Birthday Party (1969) and Battle of Britain (1969). One of his best performances of this decade was also as Spanish conqueror Pizarro in The Royal Hunt of the Sun (1969). His last published novel, \"A Card from Morocco,\" was also a big success and he went on to make Figures in a Landscape (1970) with Malcolm McDowell as two escaped convicts in a Latin American country. As the father of Churchill in Young Winston (1972), he was once again his brilliant self, stealing the scene from John Mills, Patrick Magee, Anthony Hopkins and Ian Holm. After his portrayal of Lord Randolph Churchill, he made A Reflection of Fear (1972), a horror movie with Ure, Sondra Locke and Sally Kellerman. As chauffeur Steven Ledbetter in The Hireling (1973), he falls in love with Sarah Miles, an aristocratic widow he helps recover from a nervous breakdown. The film took the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and was quite a thought-provoking film. It was his performances in the following two films--USA-produced The Sting (1973) and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974)--that Shaw became familiar once again to American audiences, but it was his portrayal as a grizzled Irish shark hunter named Quint, in Jaws (1975), that everyone remembers--even to this day. Hard to believe that Shaw wasn't that impressed with the script and even confided to a friend, Hector Elizondo: \"They want me to do a movie about this big fish. I don't know if I should do it or not.\" When Elizondo asked why Shaw had reservations, Shaw said he'd never heard of the director and didn't like the title, \"JAWS.\" It's also incredible that as the biggest box office film at the time, which was the first to gross more than $100 million worldwide and that he had ever been part of, he didn't make a cent from it because of the taxes he had to pay from working in the United States, Canada and Ireland. It was also during that time that he became a depressed recluse following the death of his wife, who had taken an accidental overdose of barbiturates and alcohol. Some have speculated throughout the years that her death was suicidal, but there was no evidence of that, and so it is mere sensationalism. Following Diamonds (1975), he made End of the Game (1975) and then delivered another brilliant performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin and Marian (1976). During the same year, he also made Swashbuckler (1976) with Geneviève Bujold and James Earl Jones, a very lighthearted pirate adventure. His next film, Black Sunday (1977), with Shaw playing an Israeli counterterrorist agent trying to stop a terrorist organization called Black September, which is plotting an attack at the Super Bowl, was a big success both with critics and at the box office. I wasn't surprised, considering the depth to which he was also involved in writing the script, although he didn't receive billing for it. Shaw was very happy with the success of his acting career but remained a depressed recluse in his personal life until he finished Black Sunday (1977), when he found himself in love with his secretary of 15 years, Virginia Dewitt Jansen (Jay). They were wed on July 29, 1976, in Hamilton, Bermuda. He adopted her son, Charles, and the couple also had one son, Thomas. During his stay in Bermuda, Shaw began work on his next movie, The Deep (1977), which teamed him and writer Peter Benchley once again, which may have been a mistake in that everyone expected another Jaws (1975). At one point, discussing how bad the film was going, Shaw could be quoted as saying to Nick Nolte, \"It's a treasure picture Nick; it's a treasure picture.\" It did well at the box office but not with critics, although they did hail Shaw as the saving grace. He had done it for the money, as he was to do with his next film, for he had decided when Ure died that life was short and he needed to provide for his 10 children. In 1977, Shaw traveled to Yugoslavia, where he starred in Force 10 from Navarone (1978), a sequel to The Guns of Navarone (1961). He revived the lead role of British MI6 agent Mallory, originally played by Gregory Peck. He was a big box office draw, and some producers were willing to pay top wages for his work, but he felt restricted by the parts he was being offered. \"I have it in mind to stop making these big-budget extravaganzas, to change my pattern of life. I wanted to prove, I think, that I could be an international movie star. Now that I've done it, I see the valuelessness of it.\" In early 1978, Shaw appeared in Avalanche Express (1979) which was to become the last film in which he played General Marenkov, a senior Russian official who decides to defect to the West and reveals to a CIA agent, played by Lee Marvin, that the Russians are trying to develop biological weapons. An alcoholic most of his life, Shaw died--before the film was completed--of a heart attack at the age of 51 on August 28, 1978. In poor health due to alcoholism during most of the filming, he in fact completed over 90% of his scenes before the death of director Mark Robson two months earlier, in June 1978, brought production to a halt. While living in Ireland and taking a hiatus from work, Shaw was driving from Castlebar to his home in Tourmakeady, Ireland, with wife, Virginia, and young son, Thomas, after spending the day playing golf with friends on a local course as well as shopping with Virginia in the town. As they approached their cottage, he felt chest pains which he claimed to Virginia had started earlier that day while he was playing golf but whose pains subsided. He pulled the car over a few hundred yards from his cottage and told her he would get out and walk the pains off. After taking four or five steps from the parked car, he collapsed by the side of the road, and his wife ran to the cottage to phone for help. An ambulance arrived 15 minutes later, and Shaw was taken to Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NzI3NTU2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUzMjkyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001727","name":"Robert

He was born Richard Stephen Dreyfus in Brooklyn, New York, to Geraldine (Robbins), an activist, and Norman Dreyfus, a restaurateur and attorney. His paternal grandparents were Austro-Hungarian Jewish immigrants, and his mother's family was Russian Jewish. Richard worked his way up through bit parts (The Graduate (1967), for one) and TV before gaining attention with his portrayal of Baby Face Nelson in John Milius' Dillinger (1973). He gained prominence as a college-bound young man in American Graffiti (1973) and as a nervy Jewish kid with high hopes in L'apprentissage de Duddy Kravitz (1974). By the latter part of the 1970s Dreyfuss was established as a major star, playing leads (and alter-egos) for Steven Spielberg in two of the top-grossing films of the that decade: Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). He won a Best Actor Oscar in his first romantic lead as an out-of-work actor in The Goodbye Girl (1977). Dreyfuss also produced and starred in the entertaining private eye movie The Big Fix (1978). After a brief lull in the early 1980s, a well-publicized drug problem and a string of box-office disappointments (The Competition (1980), Whose Life Is It Anyway? (1981), The Buddy System (1984)), a clean and sober Dreyfuss re-established himself in the mid-'80s as one of Hollywood's more engaging leads. He co-starred with Bette Midler and Nick Nolte in Paul Mazursky's popular Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986). That same year he provided the narration and appeared in the opening and closing \"bookends\" of Rob Reiner's nostalgic Stand by Me (1986). He quickly followed that with Nuts (1987) opposite Barbra Streisand, Barry Levinson's Tin Men (1987) in a memorable teaming with Danny DeVito and Stakeout (1987) with Emilio Estevez. Dreyfuss continued working steadily through the end of the 1980s and into the 1990s, most notably in Mazursky's farce Moon Over Parador (1988), Spielberg's Always (1989), Postcards from the Edge (1990) and Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990). He appeared as a member of an ensemble that included Holly Hunter, Gena Rowlands and Danny Aiello in the romantic comedy Once Around (1991) and as a pop psychiatrist, the author of several successful self-help books, who is driven to the edge by nutcase Bill Murray in the popular comedy What About Bob? (1991). Dreyfuss has also remained active in the theater (\"Death and Maiden\", 1992) and on TV. He returned to features in the adaptation of Neil Simon's play Lost in Yonkers (1993) and followed with a supporting turn as the querulous political opponent in The American President (1995). Dreyfuss received some of the best notices of his career as a determined, inspiring music teacher coping with a deaf son and the demands of his career in Mr. Holland's Opus (1995).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMjIzMjM2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAxMDY0Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000377","name":"Richard

Lorraine was raised in Los Angeles. At age 16, she won a best actress award in a competition at the prestigious Pasadena Playhouse. She was offered a scholarship to enroll at the Pasadena Playhouse, but declined said offer and attended Columbia University as a political science major, instead. Lorraine began her acting career in the late 60s doing guest appearances on several popular TV shows. Gary achieved her greatest and most enduring fame with her excellent portrayal of Sheriff Roy Scheider's caring and concerned wife in the first two \"Jaws\" pictures. Lorraine further demonstrated her considerable versatility with funny performances in the amusing comedies Car Wash (1976), Zero to Sixty (1978) and 1941 (1979). Among the television programs she's done guest spots on are The Rookies (1972), Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969), Kojak (1973), Ironside (1967), The F.B.I. (1965), The Virginian (1962), McCloud (1970) and Dragnet 1967 (1967). She came out of voluntary retirement to assume a rare substantial starring role in the regrettably dreadful Jaws: The Revenge (1987) but, alas, hasn't acted in anything since that ill-received feature.

He is of Russian Jewish descent. At 17, he took his first step towards becoming a stand-up comedian when he spontaneously took the stage at a Boston comedy club. He found he was a natural comic. He nurtured his talent while at New York University (graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991) by performing regularly in clubs and at universities. During his freshman year, he snagged a recurring role as the Huxtable family's friend Smitty on The Cosby Show (1984). While working at a comedy club in L.A., he was \"discovered\" by Dennis Miller, who recommended him to Saturday Night Live (1975) producer Lorne Michaels and told him that Sandler had a big talent. This led to his being cast in the show in 1990, which he also wrote for in addition to performing. After Saturday Night Live (1975), Sandler went on to the movies, starring in such hit comedies as Airheads (1994), Happy Gilmore (1996), Billy Madison (1995) and Big Daddy (1999). He has also starred in Mr. Deeds (2002) alongside Winona Ryder; Eight Crazy Nights (2002), an animated movie about the Jewish festival of Chanukah; and Punch-Drunk Love (2002). He also writes and produces many of his own films and has composed songs for several of them, including The Wedding Singer (1998). Sandler has had several of his songs placed on the \"Billboard\" charts, including the classic \"The Chanukah Song\".","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQyNzM2MjM1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE5NjI3Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001191","name":"Adam Sandler","nicknames":["Sandman"],"idIMDB":"nm0001191","born":"September 9, 1966 in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","starSign":"Virgo","starMeter":"76%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Uncut Gems","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5727208"},{"title":"Murder Mystery","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1618434"},{"title":"Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation","year":" 2018","remarks":["Dracula (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5220122"},{"title":"Kevin Can Wait","year":" 2016-2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5462720"},{"title":"The Week Of","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6821012"},{"title":"Real Rob","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3741346"},{"title":"Puppy!: A Hotel Transylvania Short'","year":" 2017/I","remarks":["(Short)","Dracula (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt6450752"},{"title":"The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5536736"},{"title":"Chelsea","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5672036"},{"title":"Sandy Wexler","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5893332"},{"title":"Conan","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)","Adam Sandler (segment \"Young Han Solo Audition\")"],"imdbid":"tt1637574"},{"title":"The Do-Over","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4769836"},{"title":"The Ridiculous 6","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2479478"},{"title":"Hotel Transylvania 2","year":" 2015","remarks":["Dracula (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2510894"},{"title":"Pixels","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2120120"},{"title":"The Cobbler","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3203616"},{"title":"Men, Women & Children","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3179568"},{"title":"Top Five","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2784678"},{"title":"Blended","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1086772"},{"title":"Brooklyn Nine-Nine","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2467372"},{"title":"Grown Ups 2","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2191701"},{"title":"Jessie","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1865769"},{"title":"Hotel Transylvania","year":" 2012","remarks":["Dracula (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0837562"},{"title":"That's My Boy","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1232200"},{"title":"Jack and Jill","year":" 2011/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0810913"},{"title":"Zookeeper","year":" 2011","remarks":["Donald the Monkey (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1222817"},{"title":"Just Go with It","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1564367"},{"title":"Grown Ups","year":" 2010/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1375670"},{"title":"Bridge School News","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4480484"},{"title":"Funny People","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1201167"},{"title":"Bedtime Stories","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0960731"},{"title":"You Don't Mess with the Zohan","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0960144"},{"title":"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0762107"},{"title":"The King of Queens","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0165581"},{"title":"Reign Over Me","year":" 2007","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0490204"},{"title":"Click","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0389860"},{"title":"Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo","year":" 2005","remarks":["Javier Sandooski (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0367652"},{"title":"The Longest Yard","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0398165"},{"title":"Spanglish","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0371246"},{"title":"50 First Dates","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0343660"},{"title":"Blossoms & Blood","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt0367553"},{"title":"Punch-Drunk Love: 12 Scopitones","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt7359992"},{"title":"Couch","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0365082"},{"title":"Anger Management","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0305224"},{"title":"Pauly Shore Is Dead","year":" 2003","remarks":["Adam Sandler (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0284674"},{"title":"The Hot Chick","year":" 2002","remarks":["Mambuza Bongo Guy (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0302640"},{"title":"A Day with the Meatball","year":" 2002","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0342267"},{"title":"Eight Crazy Nights","year":" 2002","remarks":["Davey / Whitey / Eleanore / ...

She is the daughter of Kathleen Ann (Craft), a philanthropist, and Martin Joseph Holmes, Sr., a lawyer. She is of German, Irish, and English ancestry. Her parents have said that her strong-willed personality is probably from being born premature. Being the youngest in the Holmes clan, completing the family of three other sisters and one brother, Katie was always the baby. As a teenager, she began attending modeling school. When she was sixteen, her teacher invited her to go to a modeling competition with other girls from her class. She competed in the International Modeling and Talent Association by singing, dancing, and reciting a monologue from To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). By the end of that time in New York, Katie won many awards. But she said she didn't want to model because it wasn't challenging enough. So when she was seventeen, Katie went to Los Angeles to audition for movies. Luckily, on her second audition, she was cast in the movie, The Ice Storm (1997), directed by Ang Lee. Katie's character was Libbets Casey, a rich New Yorker, who is pursued by two of the main characters. It was a small part, but it marked the beginning of her professional acting career. After the excitement of her first movie, Katie began sending in audition tapes for pilot shows. During that time, she was also starring in her all-girls Catholic high school musical, Damn Yankees, as Lola. After Kevin Williamson received her audition tape for his new show, Dawson's Creek (1998), the producers wanted her to come to Hollywood right away and read live for them. But because they wanted her to come on the opening night for Damn Yankees, Katie had to tell them she couldn't make it. Fortunately, the show's producers wanted her so much for that role, they rescheduled her callback and the result was she got the part as Joey Potter. During her first year with Dawson's Creek (1998), Katie was able to do two movies, Comportements troublants (1998) and Go (1999), and, for the former, she won Best Breakthrough Female Performance in the 1999 MTV Movie Awards. The following year, she starred next to Michael Douglas in Wonder Boys (2000), playing Hannah Green, a published author and a boarder at her teacher's (Douglas) house, who has a crush on him, and tries to seduce him. Her first leading role came in 2002, with Abandon (2002). She played a college student named Katie Burke, who is haunted by the mysterious disappearance of her boyfriend who vanished two years prior. With Dawson's Creek (1998) coming to a close after six years in May of 2003, it was a bittersweet thing for all the cast. Accustomed to being in North Carolina filming ten months out of a year, the cast members now had the opportunity to make more movies. Katie demonstrated this in October, when she had two new movies, Pieces of April (2003) and The Singing Detective (2003), coming out in that month alone. Pieces of April (2003) is a charming Thanksgiving movie about April (Holmes), the black sheep of her family, who wants to give her family the perfect dinner before her mother passes on. The Singing Detective (2003) is a dark musical where the main character (Robert Downey Jr.) is a writer in a hospital for skin conditions who writes a dark world of seduction and murder in his mind. Katie Holmes plays the kind Nurse Mills who tends to his every need. She also gets to lip sync and dance in this movie. In 2004, she starred in the romantic movie First Daughter (2004), in which she played the President's (Michael Keaton) daughter, Samantha, who wants to go to college without any Secret Service tagging along. In 2005, Holmes co-starred in Batman Begins (2005), where she played Rachel Dawes, a childhood sweetheart and love interest to Batman/Bruce Wayne.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA2NjY5OTkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE2NTkxNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005017","name":"Katie

Her father was of Swedish descent and her mother was of German and Norwegian ancestry. Tippi was working as a New York fashion model when she married her first husband, former child stage actor Peter Griffith, in 1952 (married until 1961). She gave birth to her only child, Melanie Griffith, on August 9, 1957. Alfred Hitchcock discovered Tippi, the pretty cover girl, while viewing a 1962 TV commercial on NBC's Today (1952). He put her under personal contract and cast her in The Birds (1963). In a cover article about the movie in Look magazine (Dec. 4, 1962), Hitchcock praised her; he also told the Associated Press: \"Tippi Hedren is really remarkable. She's already reaching the lows and highs of terror\". The film earned her both the Golden Globe and Photoplay awards for Most Promising Newcomer. She fulfilled that promise in Hitchcock's next film Marnie (1964), giving the performance of her life as a frigid, habitual thief blackmailed into marrying her boss (Sean Connery). The professional relationship with Hitchcock ended with mutual bitterness and disappointment during shooting. That year, she married her agent, Noel Marshall (married until 1982). Charles Chaplin cast her in a small role in his final film A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), which flopped. Thereafter, Tippi and her husband Marshall collected big cats and other wildlife for the film Roar (1981), which they starred in and produced. The film took 11 years and $17 million to make, but it only made $2 million worldwide. Nevertheless, the film was a turning point in her life; she became actively involved in animal rights, as well as a wide variety of humanitarian and environmental causes. She married her third husband, businessman Luis Barrenecha, in 1985 but divorced him 10 years later. In 2002, she became engaged to veterinarian Martin Dinnes, but they called it off after 6 years and no wedding. Tippi has devoted much time and effort to charitable causes: she is a volunteer International Relief Coordinator for \"Food for the Hungry\". She has traveled worldwide to set up relief programs following earthquakes, hurricanes, famine and war, and has received numerous awards for her efforts, including the Humanitarian Award presented to her by the Baha'i Faith. As for animal causes, she is founder and president of The Roar Foundation. Onscreen, she continues to work frequently in films, theater and TV. She appeared in I Woke Up Early the Day I Died (1998), finally bringing to the big screen the last screenplay written by the late Edward D. Wood Jr. in 1974 (and featuring Wood regulars Maila Nurmi and Conrad Brooks, just about the only surviving members of Wood's stock company). She also enjoyed playing comedic roles, such as an abortion rights activist in Alexander Payne's satire Citizen Ruth (1996) and slapping Jude Law in I Heart Huckabees (2004). Tippi's contributions to world cinema have been honored with Life Achievement awards in France at The Beauvais Film Festival Cinemalia 1994; in Spain, by The Fundacion Municipal De Cine in 1995; and at the Riverside International Film Festival in 2007. In 1999, Tippi was honored as \"Woman of Vision\" by Women in Film and Video in Washington, D.C., and received the Presidential Medal for her work in film from Hofstra University. She enjoys spending time with her daughter and 3 grandchildren: Alexander Bauer, Dakota Johnson and Stella Banderas.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwNjIzMTk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTM0NTk3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001335","name":"Tippi

Stewart","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Though most famous for her role as Isabella \"Bella\" Swan in The Twilight (2008) Saga, Kristen Stewart has been a working actor since her early years in Los Angeles, California, where she was born. Her parents, John Stewart and Jules Stewart, both work in film and television. Her mother is Australian. The family includes three boys, her older brother Cameron Stewart and two adopted brothers Dana and Taylor. After a talent scout caught her grade school performance in a Christmas play at the age of eight, she appeared on television in a few small roles. Her first significant role came when she was cast as Sam Jennings in The Safety of Objects (2001). Soon after that, she starred alongside Jodie Foster in the hit drama, Panic Room (2002) and was nominated for a Young Artist Award. Praised for her Panic Room performance, she went on to join the cast of Cold Creek Manor (2003) as the daughter of Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone. Though the film did not do well at the box office, she received another nomination for a Young Artist Award. After appearing in a handful of movies and a Showtime movie called Speak (2004), Stewart was cast in the role of a teenage singer living in a commune in Sean Penn's Into the Wild (2007), a critically acclaimed biopic. A third Young Artist Award nomination resulted in a win for this role. She also appeared in Mary Stuart Masterson's The Cake Eaters (2007) that same year. Just 17, Stewart took on the starring role in Twilight (2008) which was based on a series of the same name written by Stephenie Meyer, the novel already had a huge following and the film opened to fans anxious to see the vampire romance brought to life. Awarded the MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance, Stewart's turn as Bella continued in the sequels The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009) and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010). The final installments of the series start filming in late 2010. Despite her stratospheric launch into stardom with the Twilight films, she stayed true to her roots by working on a number of indie projects, including Adventureland (2009) (filmed prior to the Twilight series) and Welcome to the Rileys (2010). And she took on the daunting task of playing hard rocker Joan Jett in Floria Sigismondi's The Runaways (2010) alongside Dakota Fanning. Stewart received praise for her acting and musical performances and later won the 2010 BAFTA Rising Star Award and best actress at the Milan International Film Festival for Welcome to the Rileys (2010). Stewart starred in several other movies filmed between the Twilight Saga installments including the #1 summer box office hit, Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), and the Cannes selection Sur la route (2012) A few of Stewart's following projects are: Sundance drama Camp X-Ray (2014), Cannes selection Sils Maria (2014) for which she won a César award, and the Lionsgate distributed action comedy, American Ultra (2015), starring the Adventureland (2009) duo. Stewart continues to live in Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMjUyOTY0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI2MjA2Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829576","name":"Kristen

She has an older and younger brother. She was educated at John Burroughs School in St. Louis, Missouri, and went on to Indiana University to study Fine Arts and Italian. During Clarke's senior year at university she studied in Bologna, Italy, and it was here she began an interest in acting. When she came back to the USA, Clarke found work as an architectural photographer. The story goes that she got free acting lessons at an arts center, in exchange for taking photos for them. Clarke moved to New York and continued studying acting with various companies, including Circle in the Square Theatre School. Clarke's screen debut came in a Volkswagen television commercial called \"Synchronicity\", which went on to win awards. She worked steadily in TV and film before earning her big break when she was cast as Nina Myers in the smash hit 24 (2001). It was while working on this that Clarke met her future husband, Xander Berkeley. Various roles have followed, notably as Renée, Bella Swan's mother in the hugely successful Twilight (2008) and its sequels.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzlkMzVlMjctNjUyNC00ODcwLTg1YTktY2IwNmNkYWNkNGI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1020124","name":"Sarah Clarke","nicknames":["Creathon"],"idIMDB":"nm1020124","born":"February 16, 1972 in St. Louis, Missouri, USA","starSign":"Aquarius","starMeter":"82%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Short Straw","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6282000"},{"title":"The Grand Son","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6557356"},{"title":"Bosch","year":" 2015-2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3502248"},{"title":"The Maestro","year":" 2018/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5985672"},{"title":"Staring at the Sun","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3887462"},{"title":"Shot","year":" 2017/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4323568"},{"title":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203259"},{"title":"NCIS","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0364845"},{"title":"Carry Me","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt5078932"},{"title":"Punk's Dead: SLC Punk 2","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2836166"},{"title":"Couch Surfing USA","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4902790"},{"title":"Line of Sight","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt2992070"},{"title":"The Tomorrow People","year":" 2013-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2660734"},{"title":"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2","year":" 2012","remarks":["Renee Dwyer (credit only)"],"imdbid":"tt1673434"},{"title":"Covert Affairs","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1495708"},{"title":"A Quick Jog","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2297534"},{"title":"Nikita","year":" 2011-2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1592154"},{"title":"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1324999"},{"title":"Men of a Certain Age","year":" 2009-2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1242441"},{"title":"The Booth at the End","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1554369"},{"title":"Bedrooms","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1390533"},{"title":"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1325004"},{"title":"Below the Beltway","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1453428"},{"title":"Trust Me","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1104002"},{"title":"Women in Trouble","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1247704"},{"title":"Twilight","year":" 2008/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1099212"},{"title":"The Cleaner","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1103973"},{"title":"Wainy Days","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1137992"},{"title":"Alibi","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0883389"},{"title":"Life","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0874936"},{"title":"The Colony","year":" 2007/II","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1128212"},{"title":"A House Divided","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0757225"},{"title":"The Lather Effect","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0485927"},{"title":"Commander in Chief","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0429455"},{"title":"24: The Game","year":" 2006","remarks":["(Video Game)","Nina Myers (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0454763"},{"title":"Las Vegas","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0364828"},{"title":"E-Ring","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0460084"},{"title":"Psychic Driving","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0469959"},{"title":"House","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0412142"},{"title":"Happy Endings","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0361693"},{"title":"24","year":" 2001-2004","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0285331"},{"title":"Human Error","year":" 2004","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0389792"},{"title":"The Third Date","year":" 2003/II","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0337732"},{"title":"Karen Sisco","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0364823"},{"title":"Thirteen","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0328538"},{"title":"Emmett's Mark","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0287425"},{"title":"The Accident","year":" 2001","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0289838"},{"title":"Ed","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0247091"},{"title":"All About George","year":" 2000","remarks":["(Short)","Catherine (as Sarah Lively)"],"imdbid":"tt0309266"},{"title":"Pas de deux","year":" 2000/I","remarks":["The Clown (as Sarah Lively)"],"imdbid":"tt0286883"},{"title":"Sex and the City","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0159206"},{"title":"Interior.

He began singing at age nine, and joined a band at age fifteen. He continued to work with bands and study/performing drama at Western Washington University. He performed in Seattle at the Annex Theater, New City Festival, and the A.H.A. Theater, though it was as a musician, not an actor, that Burke first moved to Los Angeles. A demo deal with a major record label that \"didn't quite pan out\", left him to explore the only other thing he \"knew he was good at\". With two independent films shot in his native Seattle under his belt, he began auditioning and very soon working as an actor. He made his feature film debut in the independent film Daredreamer (1990). After a string of mostly \"bad guy with facial hair\" TV guest appearances, he landed his first studio picture role in the Zucker brothers' genre spoof Mafia! (1998). Capitalizing on his deadpan comedic sensibilities, he then won the title role in Dill Scallion (1999), the cult classic \"mockumentary\" about the rise and fall of a slightly touched country music singer. Co-starring in \"Dill\", was then fledgling writer/director Peter Berg. It was Berg who brought Billy back to television to play \"Dr. Abe Matthews\" in the acclaimed ABC drama Wonderland (2000). Although its life on the air was short-lived, Wonderland (2000) won the hearts of critics and fans, alike, and was recently re-released in its entirety on DirecTV. Paramount's Along Came a Spider (2001) marked Billy's first revisit to studio films. He then returned yet again to television for the second season of Fox's mega hit series 24 (2001). His disturbing portrayal of abusive father and husband \"Gary Matheson\" still resonates as a fan favorite. In 2004, Billy teamed up with John Travolta and Joaquin Phoenix in the firefighter drama Ladder 49 (2004). It was here that the studios once again began to recognize his on-screen magnetism. So, after another steady stream of notable television performances, he was cast alongside Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling in New Line's hit thriller Fracture (2007), directed by NYPD Blue (1993) creator Gregory Hoblit. This multi-layered turn as a flawed cop snared by his own aberrations caught the eye of Academy Award winning director Robert Benton. Benton swiftly invited Billy to join the cast of his and Lakeshore Entertainment's Feast of Love (2007), which included Morgan Freeman and Greg Kinnear. As fate would have it, neither Gregory Hoblit nor Lakeshore had seen enough of Burke's dry wit and unshakable persona, so when it came time to find a match for Diane Lane in Untraceable (2008), he got the call to play the rock solid \"Detective Eric Box\". Since arriving in Hollywood in the early 90s, Billy Burke has never stopped working. There are countless credits that come in between the aforementioned that of course, also serve as a testament to his gift and longevity. However, it was a chance viewing of Dill Scallion (1999) that struck an indelible head turn for director Catherine Hardwicke. The impression Billy's performance left, lasted until they met in 2007 while Hardwicke and Summit Entertainment were looking for someone to play \"Charlie Swan\" in their film adaptations of the bestselling book series The \"Twilight\" Saga. After a brief meeting and read-through of a few scenes, Billy and Catherine agreed... it was \"meant to be\". Summit followed suit and welcomed him into the franchise. Millions of fans around the world have concurred with the choice and the overwhelming response to his theatrical work has given him solace in the fact that he never got that record deal.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDNjNmUzZWQtODZjYi00MGU2LWJhY2YtMjEyYTUyOTI0ZDhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIyMjAwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0121605","name":"Billy

for this superstar entertainer who has well surpassed the four-decade mark while improbably transforming herself from an artificial, glossy \"flashionplate\" singer into a serious, Oscar-worthy, dramatic actress ... and back again! With more ups and downs than the 2008 Dow Jones Industrial Average, Cher managed to rise like a phoenix from the ashes each time she was down and counted out, somehow re-inventing herself with every changing decade and finding herself on top all over again. As a singer Cher is the only performer to have earned \"top 10\" hit singles in four consecutive decades; as an actress, she and Barbra Streisand are the only two Best Actress Oscar winners to have a #1 hit song on the Billboard charts. At age 62, Cher has yet to decide to get completely off her fabulous roller coaster ride, although she has threatened to on occasion. The daughter of a truck driver, John Sarkisian, and an Arkansas-born mother, Georgia Holt (the former Jackie Jean Crouch), Cher was born in El Centro, California, on May 20, 1946. She has a sister, Georganne LaPiere. Cher is of Armenian heritage on her father's side, and of English and German, with more distant Irish, Dutch, and French, heritage on her mother's side. The father deserted the family when Cher was young, and she was raised by their mother who later married Gilbert LaPiere, a banker. Cher's mother, who had aspirations of being an actress and model herself, paid for Cher's acting classes despite her daughter having undiagnosed dyslexia, which acutely affected her studies. Frustrated, Cher quit Fresno High School at the age of 16 in search of her dream. At that time, she had a brief relationship with actor Warren Beatty. Meeting the quite older (by 11 years) Sonny Bono in 1962 changed the 16-year-old's life forever. Bono was working for record producer Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood at the time and managed to persuade Spector to hire Cher as a session singer. As such, she went on to record backup on such Spector classics as \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\" and \"Be My Baby\". The couple's relationship eventually shifted from soul mates to lovers and she and Sonny married on October 27, 1964. At first Cher sang solo with Sonny behind the scenes writing, arranging and producing her songs. The records went nowhere. Sonny then decided they needed to perform as a team so they put out two songs in 1964 under the recording names of Caesar and Cleo (\"The Letter\" and \"Baby Don't Go\"). Again, no success. The changing of their names, however, seemed to make a difference and in 1965, they officially took on the music world as Sonny & Cher and earned instant rewards. The now 19-year-old Cher and 30-year-old Sonny became huge hits following the release of their first album, \"Look at Us\" (summer, 1965), which contained the hit single \"I Got You Babe\". With the song catapulting to #1, they decided to re-release their earlier single \"Baby Don't Go\", and it also raced up the charts to #8. An assembly line of mild hits dotted the airwaves over the next year or two, culminating in the huge smash hit \"The Beat Goes On\" (#6, 1967). Between 1965 and 1972 Sonny & Cher charted a total of six \"Top 10\" hits. The kooky couple became icons of the late '60s \"flower power\" scene, wearing garish garb and outlandish hairdos and makeup. However, they found a way to make it trendy and were embraced around the world. TV musical variety and teen pop showcases relished their contrasting styles -- the short, excitable, mustachioed, nasal-toned simpleton and the taller, exotic, unflappable fashion maven. They found a successful formula with their repartee, which became a central factor in their live concert shows, even more than their singing. With all this going on, Sonny still endeavored to promote Cher as a solo success. Other than such hits with \"All I Really Want to Do\" (#16) and \"Bang, Bang\" (#2), she struggled to find a separate identity. Sonny even arranged film projects for her but Good Times (1967), an offbeat fantasy starring the couple and directed by future powerhouse William Friedkin, and Cher's serious solo effort Chastity (1969) both flickered out and died a quick death. By the end of the 1960s, Sonny & Cher's career had stumbled as they witnessed the American pop culture experience a drastic evolutionary change. The couple maintained their stage act and all the while Sonny continued to polish it up in a shrewd gamble for TV acceptance. While Sonny on stage played the ineffectual object of Cher's stinging barbs on stage, he was actually the highly motivated mastermind off stage and, amazingly enough, his foresight and chutzpah really paid off. Although the couple had lost favor with the new 70s generation, Sonny encouraged TV talent scouts to catch their live act. The network powers-that-be saw potential in the duo as they made a number of guest TV appearances in specials and on variety and talk shows and in what was essentially \"auditioning\" for their own TV vehicle. The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour (1971) was given the green light as a summer replacement series and was an instant sensation when it earned its own time spot that fall season. The show received numerous Emmy Award nominations during its run and the couple became stars all over again. Their lively, off-the-wall comedy sketch routines, her outré Bob Mackie fashions and their harmless, edgy banter were the highlights of the hour-long program. Audiences took strongly to the couple who appeared to have a deep-down sturdy relationship. Their daughter Chaz Bono occasionally added to the couple's loving glow on the show. Cher's TV success also generated renewed interest in her as a solo recording artist and she came up with three #1 hits during this time (\"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves,\" \"Half-Breed\" and \"Dark Lady\"). Behind the scenes, though, it was a different story. A now-confident Cher yearned to be free of husband Sonny's Svengali-like control over her life and career. The marriage split at the seams in 1974 and they publicly announced their separation. The show, which had earned Cher a Golden Globe Award, took a fast tumble as the separation and divorce grew more acrimonious. Eventually they both tried to launch their own solo variety shows, but both failed to even come close to their success as a duo. Audiences weren't interested in Cher without Sonny, and vice versa. In late June of 1975, only three days after the couple's divorce, Cher married rock musician Gregg Allman of The Allman Brothers Band. That marriage imploded rather quickly amid reports of out-of-control drug use on his part. They were divorced by 1977 with only one bright outcome -- son Elijah Allman. In 1976 Sonny and Cher attempted to \"make up\" again, this time to the tune of a second The Sonny and Cher Show (1976). Audiences, however, did not accept the \"friendly\" divorced couple after so much tabloid nastiness. After the initial curiosity factor wore off, the show was canceled amid poor ratings. Moreover, the musical variety show format was on its way out as well. Once again, another decade was looking to end badly for Cher. Cher found a mild success with the \"top 10\" disco hit \"Take Me Home\" in 1979, but not much else. Not one to be counted out, however, the ever resourceful singer decided to lay back and focus on acting instead. At age 36, Cher made her Broadway debut in 1982 in what was essentially her first live acting role with \"Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean\". Centering around a reunion of girlfriends from an old James Dean fan club, her performance was critically lauded. This earned her the right to transfer her stage triumph to film alongside Karen Black and Sandy Dennis. Cher earned critical raves for Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982), her first film role since 1969. With film #2 came a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win for her portrayal of a lesbian toiling in a nuclear parts factory in Silkwood (1983), starring Meryl Streep and Kurt Russell. This in turn was followed by her star turn in Mask (1985) as the blunt, footloose mother of a son afflicted with a rare disease (played beautifully by Eric Stoltz). Once again Cher received high praise and copped a win from the Cannes Film Festival for her poignant performance. Fully accepted by this time as an actress of high-caliber, she integrated well into the Hollywood community. Proving that she could hold up a film outright, she was handed three hit vehicles to star in: The Witches of Eastwick (1987), Suspect (1987), and Moonstruck (1987), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Along with all this newfound Hollywood celebrity came interest in her as a singer and recording artist again. \"If I Could Turn Back Time (#3) and the Peter Cetera duet \"After All\" (#6) placed her back on the Billboard charts. During the 1990s Cher continued to veer back and forth among films, TV specials and expensively mounted concerts. In January of 1998, tragedy struck when Cher's ex-husband Sonny Bono, who had forsaken an entertainment career for California politics and became a popular Republican congressman in the process, was killed in a freak skiing accident. That same year the duo received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contribution to television. In the meantime an astounding career adrenalin rush came in the form of a monstrous, disco-flavored hit single (\"Believe\"). The song became a #1 hit and the same-titled album the biggest hit of her career. \"Believe\" reached #1 in 23 different countries. Having little to prove anymore to anyone, Cher decided to embark on a \"Farewell Tour\" in the early part of the millennium and, after much stretching, her show finally closed in 2005 in Los Angeles. It didn't take long, however, for Cher to return from this self-imposed exile. In 2008, she finalized a deal with Las Vegas' Caesars Palace for the next three years to play the Colosseum. Never say never. Cher returned to films, co-starring opposite Christina Aguilera in Burlesque (2010). In other facets of her life, Cher has been involved with many humanitarian groups and charity efforts over the years, particularly her work as National Chairperson and Honorary Spokesperson of the Children's Craniofacial Association, which was inspired by her work in Mask (1985).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NTM4NzQ1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc3MDgwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000333","name":"Cher","nicknames":["The Goddess of Pop","The Queen of Reinvention","The Queen of Comebacks","The Queen of Camp"],"idIMDB":"nm0000333","born":"May 20, 1946 in El Centro, California, USA","starSign":"Taurus","starMeter":"66%","filmographies":[{"section":"Soundtrack","filmography":[{"title":"Mamma Mia!

Elliott began his acting career on the stage and his film debut was in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Although his future wife, Katharine Ross co-starred in the film, the two did not meet until they filmed The Legacy (1978) Together. Over the years there would be few opportunities to act in feature westerns, but it would be television that gave him that opportunity, in The Sacketts (1979), The Shadow Riders (1982) and The Yellow Rose (1983), among others. He would also work in non-westerns, usually as a tough guy, as in Lifeguard (1976) and Road House (1989). In the 1990s, Elliott was back on the western trail, playing everyone from Brig. Gen. John Buford in the film Gettysburg (1993) to Wild Bill Hickok in the made-for-TV movie Buffalo Girls (1995). In 1991 he wrote the screenplay and co-starred with his wife in the made-for-TV western Conagher (1991).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTk4NDgzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjU5Nzc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000385","name":"Sam

independent and studio films. He was born on September 30, 1961 in Whittier, California, to Evelyn Vawter, a violinist and schoolteacher, and Jack Stoltz, an elementary school teacher. He has German, English, and Scottish ancestry. Eric was raised in both American Samoa and Santa Barbara, California, where by the age of fourteen, he was earning money by playing piano for the local musical theater productions, including \"Mame\" starring Anthony Edwards, whom he co-starred with as two of Jeff Spicoli's stoner friends in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982). The two became friends, and then college roommates when both attended the University of Southern California. Dropping out in his junior year, Eric joined a repertory company that did 10 plays at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland. Moving to New York in 1981, he studied with Stella Adler and Peggy Feury, and soon appeared in his first film, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982). In the 1980s, he garnered attention (and a Golden Globe Nomination) starring as Rocky Dennis in Mask (1985), and in John Hughes' Some Kind of Wonderful (1987). In 1988, he made his Broadway debut in Great Performances: Our Town (1989), for which he was nominated for a Tony Award. In the 1990s, he went back and forth from stage to film, building up an eclectic resume that included studio films (Pulp Fiction (1994), independent films (Sundance Festival Winner The Waterdance (1992), and films that he himself produced (Mr. Jealousy (1997). He also continued to appear on the New York stage both on Broadway (Three Sisters, Two Shakespearean Actors) and off-Broadway (The Importance of Being Ernest, The Glass Menagerie). He continued to work in television as well, doing a recurring role as Helen Hunt's ex on Mad About You (1992), a year on Chicago Hope (1994), and in the television and cable movies Inside (1996) (directed by Arthur Penn), A Killer in the Family (1983) (with Robert Mitchum) and The Passion of Ayn Rand (1999) (with Helen Mirren). Eric Stoltz lives in New Mexico, and has been romantically linked to Ally Sheedy, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Lili Taylor, and Bridget Fonda,. Since 2002 he has concentrated mainly on directing, having done a television movie, several short films, several independent films, and television shows such as Grey's Anatomy (2005), Boston Legal (2004), Nashville (2012), and Glee (2009). In 2014 he became the producing director of the hit CBS show, Madam Secretary (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1Njc5MjQyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQzNzgz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000655","name":"Eric

A favorite firecracker on 80s and 90s television, tiny character player Estelle Getty became best known for her carping, meddlesome moms -- complete with bemused, cynical looks, irreverent digs and dead-pan Henny Youngman-like one-liners. Blunt and down-to-earth off-stage as she was on-, she scored big points with both the young and the old...and all those who fell in between. The middle-class masses and society's underdogs deemed Estelle one of their own. The star who had a hard time playing the star card also taught an earnest lesson to the millions of actor wannabes that it was never too late to get into the big leagues, pursue your dream and come out a winner. After nearly five decades of stage work, she achieved \"overnight\" stardom at age 62. Ill health forced her retirement in 2000 after only a decade and a half of celebrity. Yet even something as sinister as Lewy body dementia, a degenerative brain disease, couldn't take away her indomitable spirit and feistiness. The affliction, which slowly clouds then erases the memory banks, should have claimed her a couple of years after its detection, but she proved the doctors wrong and lived nearly eight years from its onset, dying peacefully in her Hollywood home on July 22, 2008. Getty was born Estelle Scher on July 25, 1923, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City, the daughter of Sarah (Lacher) and Charles Scher, Polish Jewish immigrants who worked in the glass business. Starry-eyed as a very young child when her father first took her to see a vaudeville show at the New York Academy of Music, Estelle already had a mindset about her future. She almost immediately started taking singing, dancing and acting lessons and, following her graduation from Seward Park High School, began building up experience in the Yiddish theater. She even attempted the stand-up comedy stage on the Catskills \"borscht belt\" circuit in upstate New York, but it was a time of rampant sexism and women comics were a rarity and seldom successful. She wasn't. Her young life took an abrupt, post-World War II turn when she married New York businessman Arthur Gettleman at age 24 in December of 1947 (she went on to use a derivative of her married last name for the stage). Not your typical domesticated wife by any stretch of the imagination, Estelle nevertheless raised two children, sons Barry and Carl, and worked as a secretary for various companies over time. Determined as ever to be an actress, she found moderate compensation performing in community theatre plays. Adept at playing abrasive, insinuating types, she had an innate gift for comedy and stole many scenes in such light-hearted plays as \"Arsenic and Old Lace,\" \"Blithe Spirit,\" \"6 Rms Riv Vu,\" \"Light Up the Sky\" and \"Lovers and Other Strangers\". On the flip side, Estelle demonstrated surprising dramatic stamina in such classics as \"All My Sons,\" \"The Glass Menaqerie\" and \"Death of a Salesman.\" Following decades of obscurity, it was her connection to the actor/playwright Harvey Fierstein that turned the tide and started the ball rolling. Forging a deep friendship in the late 70s after appearing in small New York theaters together, and after considerable prodding by Estelle, Harvey wrote a part for his diminutive friend in the ground-breaking, autobiographical \"Torch Song Trilogy\". Playing Harvey's recalcitrant mother, the show eventually made it to Broadway and Estelle's big debut was a resounding success. Winning the Helen Hayes Award for her performance, she played the feisty foil to Fierstein's raspy-voiced drag queen for five years. While on tour with the play in Los Angeles, Estelle secured an audition for and won the role of viper-tongued Sicilian mama Sophia Petrillo on The Golden Girls (1985). She nearly lost out on the part when it was thought she came off too young to play Bea Arthur's mother. In truth, Estelle was 14 months younger than Bea. Given another go-around, and this time donning a grey wig, age makeup and frumpy apparel, Estelle fully convinced the powers-that-be that she WAS Sophia and the rest is history. The role was a breath of fresh air during an era of strong political correctness. A seven-time consecutive Emmy Award nominee for \"Best Supporting Actress Award,\" she took home the trophy in 1988. In both 1991 and 1992 Estelle won the American Comedy Award for \"Best Supporting Actress\" in a series. The Sophia character was so popular she even went on to play the impish octogenarian in several other shows, including two \"Golden Girls\" spin-offs -- the short-lived The Golden Palace (1992) and \"Empty Nest\". Estelle went on to mother other stars on the big screen as well, including Cher in Mask (1985) and Sylvester Stallone in Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992), the latter in which she received second billing. The one maternal film role she wanted more than anything did not come her way. When Torch Song Trilogy (1988) was made into a film, actor Fierstein needed star power surrounding him. Anne Bancroft replaced Estelle in the part and she was heartbroken. The movie itself lost much of its impact in its transition from the stage. At the peak of her TV fame, Estelle wrote a 1988 autobiography entitled \"If I Knew Then, What I Know Now... So What?\" with Steve Delsohn. The diminutive dynamo (4'10\") with a big heart was an outspoken activist for gay rights and regularly involved herself in AIDS causes, part of it propelled by a nephew who was diagnosed and later succumbed to the disease. She also became a spokesperson for Alternative Living for the Aging, a nonprofit organization that locates cooperative housing for senior citizens. In 2000, Getty stopped making public appearances after her health and mind began its slow decline. One of her last sightings was in the L.A. audience of \"The Vagina Monologues,\" which starred \"Golden Girls\" co-star Rue McClanahan. Misdiagnosed as having both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, it was later learned she was suffering from advanced dementia. Estelle died of complications from her disease just three days before her 85th birthday. Long-time husband Arthur, who was only 5'3\" tall himself, never adjusted to Estelle's meteoric rise and the media attention that accompanied it. He quietly maintained her parents' glass business far from the Hollywood glitz...in Florida. He died in 2004. Lifetime television hosted a \"Golden Girls\" reunion, but by this time Estelle was too ill to appear. Shortly after her death, and in tribute to Ms. Getty, Lifetime, which shows reruns of \"The Golden Girls\" almost on a daily basis, announced that it would air ten episodes of the series featuring the \"best of Sophia\".

Her most prominent roles include the series Bates Motel (2013), and the films The Last Airbender (2010) and Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014). Nicola was born in Westchester County, New York, to Claudia (Heffner), who has worked as a model, and Nelson Peltz, a billionaire businessman whose assets include the Snapple brand of drinks. Nicola is of Ashkenazi Jewish (from her father) and German, Welsh, and English (from her mother) heritage. Nicola made her stage debut in 2007, opposite Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, in the Laurence Olivier Award-winning production of \"Blackbird\", at the Manhattan Theatre Club, directed by Joe Mantello. In 2012, she starred, alongside Melanie Lynskey and Campbell Scott, in Eye of the Hurricane (2012), a compelling family adventure about a small Everglades community struggling to put their lives back together in the wake of a devastating hurricane. In 2010, Peltz starred in M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender (2010), opposite Dev Patel and Jackson Rathbone. The film was written, directed and produced by Shyamalan and was based on the first season of Nickelodeon's animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender (2003). Peltz made her feature film debut in 2006 in Deck the Halls (2006), with Danny DeVito, Matthew Broderick and Kristin Chenoweth. In Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), Peltz stars alongside Mark Wahlberg and Jack Reynor. She plays Tessa Yeager, the daughter of a mechanic (Wahlberg) who makes a major discovery that catches the attention of the Autobots, Decepticons, and the U.S. government. The film is the fourth in the blockbuster series of live-action films, and is scheduled for release by Paramount on June 27th. Later this summer, Peltz will also star in Kevin Asch's Affluenza (2014), which is set for limited release in July. The film is a coming- of-age story, inspired by \"The Great Gatsby\" and is set amongst the upper-class in the Long Island suburb of Great Neck, during the weeks leading up to the financial meltdown of 2008. On the small screen, Peltz reprised her role as \"Bradley Martin\", a troubled high school student, in the second season of A&E's critically-acclaimed series, Bates Motel (2013). The series is a modern re-imagining and prequel to the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock cult classic, Psycho (1960), which focuses on the life of \"Norman Bates\" and his mother, \"Norma Bates\", portrayed by Freddie Highmore and Vera Farmiga.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdjZWMzYjctZTNiNC00MDc4LWE2ZTMtMDVmOWU3YzI4ZWE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkyNTc4MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2443758","name":"Nicola Peltz","nicknames":["Nicky"],"idIMDB":"nm2443758","born":"January 9, 1995 in Westchester County, New York, USA","starSign":"Capricorn","starMeter":"49%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Above the Line","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4150424"},{"title":"Our House","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2018069"},{"title":"Back Roads","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0972544"},{"title":"When the Street Lights Go On","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2140663"},{"title":"Inhumans","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt4154858"},{"title":"Youth in Oregon","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3687316"},{"title":"Bates Motel","year":" 2013-2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2188671"},{"title":"Affluenza","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1906384"},{"title":"Transformers: Age of Extinction","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2109248"},{"title":"Eye of the Hurricane","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1647665"},{"title":"The Last Airbender","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0938283"},{"title":"Harold","year":" 2008","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1041753"},{"title":"Deck the Halls","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0790604"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"Love Advent","year":" 2018","remarks":["(TV Series short)"],"imdbid":"tt6717892"},{"title":"Evolution with Extinction","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt5483934"},{"title":"Entertainment Tonight","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0081857"},{"title":"M3 Countdown","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3819212"},{"title":"Made in Hollywood","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0911896"},{"title":"Made in Hollywood: Teen Edition","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1245693"},{"title":"Jimmy Kimmel Live!","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0320037"},{"title":"The Insider","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0430836"},{"title":"Sidewalks Entertainment","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094547"},{"title":"Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards 2014","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt3593292"},{"title":"Hello!

Both of his parents were teachers: his mother taught general education and his dad taught calligraphy. He became interested in acting at the age of 24, when a director of England's National Theatre Company, where he was studying, told him that acting was his special gift. In 1978, he moved to Tokyo to pursue acting. He drew the attention of the critics when Yukio Ninagawa, a famous Japanese director, chose him for the lead role in one of his plays, even though Ken was still an acting student. He made his first TV appearance in 1982, and his big career breakthrough came when he was chosen to play the lead in the Japanese national TV drama series called \"Dokugan ryu Masamune\"; he played a samurai leader hero, making him a household name in Japan. In 1989, when he was shooting a movie in Canada, he collapsed because of leukemia. He made a miraculous comeback and, in 2003, co-starred with Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai (2003), which pushed him to the center stage of Hollywood. \"The Last Samurai\" was his 15th movie, and Ken is mostly known in Japan for playing samurais, though he has also starred as a gangster, a businessman, and a general. Ken has a daughter, Anne Watanabe, who is a model, actress, and singer, and a son. He is a fanatic fan of Hanshin Tigers (Japanese professional baseball team) and Kobe Steel rugby team. He loves noodles.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMTUzNjc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUyODU2Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0913822","name":"Ken Watanabe","idIMDB":"nm0913822","born":"October 21, 1959 in Uonuma, Japan","starSign":"Libra","starMeter":"89%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Detective Pikachu","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5884052"},{"title":"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3741700"},{"title":"Bel Canto","year":" 2018/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6046314"},{"title":"The King and I","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt8887846"},{"title":"L'île aux chiens","year":" 2018","remarks":["Head Surgeon (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5104604"},{"title":"Transformers: The Last Knight","year":" 2017","remarks":["Drift (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt3371366"},{"title":"The Memories of Happiness","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt6274440"},{"title":"Gonenme no hitori","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt5833690"},{"title":"Rage","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4384088"},{"title":"The Sea of Trees","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3450900"},{"title":"Oyaji no senaka","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3748808"},{"title":"Silver Jack","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt3715860"},{"title":"Transformers: Age of Extinction","year":" 2014","remarks":["Drift (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2109248"},{"title":"Godzilla","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0831387"},{"title":"Unforgiven","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2347134"},{"title":"Makete, katsu: Sengo wo tsukutta otoko Yoshida Shigeru","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2235066"},{"title":"Hayabusa: The Long Voyage Home","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1825130"},{"title":"Ai inochi -

Sell, a radio actress, and Joe Cranston, an actor and former amateur boxer. His maternal grandparents were German, and his father was of Irish, German, and Austrian-Jewish ancestry. He was raised partly by his grandparents, living on their poultry farm in the Canoga Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Cranston's father walked out on the family when Cranston was 11 years old, and they did not see each other again until 11 years later, when Cranston and his brother decide to track down their father. Cranston is known for his roles as Walter White on the AMC crime drama Breaking Bad (2008), Hal on the Fox situation comedy Malcolm in the Middle (2000), and Dr. Tim Whatley on five episodes of the NBC situation comedy Seinfeld (1989). For his role on \"Breaking Bad\", he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series four times (2008-2010, 2014), including three consecutive wins. After becoming one of the producers during the series' fourth and fifth seasons, he also won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series twice. In June 2014, Cranston won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his portrayal of Lyndon Johnson in the play \"All the Way\" on Broadway. He reprised the role of Lyndon Johnson in the television adaptation All the Way (2016), which earned him widespread praise by critics. For the biographical drama Trumbo (2015), he earned widespread acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Cranston also appeared in several acclaimed films, such as Saving Private Ryan (1998), Little Miss Sunshine (2006), Drive (2011), Argo (2012) and Godzilla (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2NjEyMTY4MTVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ5NDAzNDc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0186505","name":"Bryan

He traveled extensively as his father literally flew around the world. Before he was out of his teens, he had attended high schools in Heidelberg, Germany and San Antonio, Texas, then enrolled the University of North Texas -- attracted by the chance of playing trumpet in one of the college's celebrated jazz bands. Music is in his family. Three generations on his mother's side were piano players and jazz is still his overriding interest. Ask him who his favorite performer in any art form is and he will say Miles Davis. It was with a B.A. in Theatre and a scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts that he left Texas for New York. Two weeks after graduating, he made his first appearance on Broadway as David in Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival production of David Rabe's \"Sticks and Bones\", a role he repeated on the London stage. While a student of legendary actress and drama coach, Uta Hagen, Weller appeared on and off Broadway in works like William Inge's \"Summer Brave\", Thomas Babe's \"Rebel Women\" and \"Full Circle\", one of the last plays directed by Otto Preminger. He began garnering critical acclaim with his portrayal of Billie Wilson in \"Streamers\", directed by Mike Nichols for Joseph Papp at Lincoln Center. He continued that success with his performances as Cliff in \"The Woolgatherer\" and as Nick in the first American production of David Mamet's \"The Woods\". During this period, he became a member of the highly respected Actor's Studio, under the aegis of Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg. Weller's film debut was in Richard Lester's Butch and Sundance: The Early Days (1979). He then co-starred with Alan King and Ali MacGraw in Sidney Lumet's Just Tell Me What You Want (1980) and, with Albert Finney and Diane Keaton, in Alan Parker's Shoot the Moon (1982). Other film credits include Firstborn (1984) with Teri Garr, the HBO made-for-TV Apology (1986), co-starring Lesley Ann Warren, and D'origine inconnue (1983), the film which won Weller the Best Actor award at the Paris International Film Festival for his performance as an upwardly mobile bachelor with a serious rat problem. That same film also marked his first association with Leviathan (1989) director George P. Cosmatos.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5MTIxNTM1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTMzNjc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000693","name":"Peter Weller","nicknames":["Pete"],"idIMDB":"nm0000693","born":"June 24, 1947 in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, USA","starSign":"Cancer","starMeter":"68%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Forever","year":" 2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt7720790"},{"title":"Longmire","year":" 2012-2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1836037"},{"title":"The Last Ship","year":" 2017","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2402207"},{"title":"Yamasong: March of the Hollows","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt4191486"},{"title":"Wilson's Heart","year":" 2017","remarks":["(Video Game)","Robert Wilson (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5848346"},{"title":"Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video Game)","Vice Admiral Caleb Thies (voice, uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt5686128"},{"title":"Sons of Anarchy","year":" 2013-2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1124373"},{"title":"Skin Trade","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1641841"},{"title":"Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Video Game)","RoboCop (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt4916238"},{"title":"Star Trek: Into Darkness","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1408101"},{"title":"Hawaii Five-0","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1600194"},{"title":"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Video)","Batman / Bruce Wayne (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2166834"},{"title":"Repentance","year":" 2013/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2012665"},{"title":"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video)","Batman / Bruce Wayne (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt2313197"},{"title":"Franklin & Bash","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1600199"},{"title":"House","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0412142"},{"title":"Dragon Eyes","year":" 2012","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1735862"},{"title":"Forced to Fight","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1884312"},{"title":"Psych","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0491738"},{"title":"Dexter","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0773262"},{"title":"Once Fallen","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1087524"},{"title":"Fringe","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1119644"},{"title":"Prey","year":" 2007/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0468536"},{"title":"The Hard Easy","year":" 2006","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0425087"},{"title":"Monk","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0312172"},{"title":"24","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0285331"},{"title":"The Poseidon Adventure","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0419358"},{"title":"Undiscovered","year":" 2005","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0434424"},{"title":"Codename: Panzers, Phase Two","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Video Game)","Jeffrey S.

At a young age, she trained for a dancing career at the High School of Performing Arts, and then attended Jose Quintano's School for Young Professionals. In dozens of television commercials from the age of 15, Nancy made her first film appearance in The Last Detail (1973) with Jack Nicholson. Three years later, she set the standard for all future \"bitch-goddess teenagers\" as Chris Hargensen in Stephen King's Carrie (1976), taken to the big screen by director Brian De Palma. Nancy then married De Palma in 1979. She next appeared in Steven Spielberg's I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978); for the next few years, she appeared only in De Palma's films: Home Movies (1979), Dressed to Kill (1980), and she starred with John Travolta in Blow Out (1981). After her divorce from De Palma in 1984, Nancy's film opportunities were supposedly narrowed, but then she surprised the whole world in 1987 when she performed as Officer Anne Lewis in the sci-fi cult film RoboCop (1987), along with Peter Weller. Here, she set another standard as a tough but at the same time feminine policewoman, whose sex would not interfere with her actions. After the success of RoboCop, she performed as Patricia Gardner in the second sequel in the Poltergeist series. She came back in RoboCop 2 (1990) and in order to get more involved with the character Nancy Allen learned martial arts and police training for real. She returned again in RoboCop 3 (1993), though her co-star Peter Weller did not this time. In 1993, Nancy joined several other veteran stars in Acting on Impulse (1993), and married co-star Craig Shoemaker, in the same year. A few years later, she divorced Craig and some time after she married again. Later, she appeared in some diverse films: Dusting Cliff 7 (1997) Secret of the Andes (1998), Circuit (2001), and she had a guest appearance in Steven Soderbergh's Out of Sight (1998). Her last performance was for the television series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), in the episode \"Escape\" aired on December 2, 2003. Allen has recently appeared in several documentaries about her most famous films: Acting 'Carrie' (2001), _DVD BackStory: RoboCop (2001)_, The Making of 'Dressed to Kill' (2001), DVD _ET True Hollywood Stories: The Curse of Poltergeist (2002)_. Interested in projecting the image of a strong but at the same time feminine woman, she managed to get away from the victim roles she was always offered, she also was able to get away from the stereotype of the beautiful but dumb woman in most action films. She is an environmentalist that traded her Volvo car for an Hybrid car in order to set the example. She is also an activist against breast Cancer along with her friend actress Wendie Jo Sperber, who created the foundation WeSpark. Her last appearance on television was on the Inside E! story of her co-star John Travolta and the A&E Biography of Travolta - both appearances in 2004. Nowadays, Nancy Allen lives a quiet life along with her family and friends somewhere in the United States.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MjU5MzIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM2NTgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000262","name":"Nancy Allen","nicknames":["The Scream Queen"],"idIMDB":"nm0000262","born":"June 24, 1950 in New York City, New York, USA","starSign":"Cancer","starMeter":"65%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"My Apocalypse","year":" 2008/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119970"},{"title":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203259"},{"title":"The Division","year":" 2002","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0272376"},{"title":"Circuit","year":" 2001","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0218107"},{"title":"Judging Amy","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0209069"},{"title":"Kiss Toledo Goodbye","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0156711"},{"title":"Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return","year":" 1999","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0177625"},{"title":"Secret of the Andes","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0144597"},{"title":"Out of Sight","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0120780"},{"title":"The Pass","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0144548"},{"title":"Against the Law","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0189340"},{"title":"Dusting Cliff 7","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0171465"},{"title":"L'as de la crime","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101069"},{"title":"Au-delà du réel -

The tall, distinguished-looking university graduate boasted a rich, resonant voice, which enabled him to easily find work in radio plays, as well on the stage. He first came to note as a small part actor with the Gate and Abbey Theatre Players, on occasion putting his architectural qualifications to use as a set designer. His first leading role was in Sean O'Casey's play 'Red Roses for Me' in 1944. During one of his performances in Dublin, he was spotted by the director Carol Reed and cast as an IRA terrorist in Odd Man Out (1947). This, and another London-produced film, Hungry Hill (1947), resulted in good critical notices , prompting another genial filmmaker, Orson Welles, to cast O'Herlihy in the role of Macduff for his Mercury/Republic production of Macbeth (1948). While this enterprise was far from successful, O'Herlihy's rugged, bearded appearance for the Scottish play sufficiently impressed Luis Buñuel to cast him in the titular role of Robinson Crusoe (1954). Until the arrival of 'Friday' - the only other featured character - this definitive version of Daniel Defoe's shipwrecked 17th century mariner was a tour-de-force one man show, a compelling, wordless portrayal of agonising solitude. However, since the Mexican production was considered merely a B-movie in Hollywood, O'Herlihy was forced to invest some of his own money to have the film exhibited in Los Angeles. While he was rewarded with an Oscar nomination, few worthy job offers came his way. For the remainder of the decade, he worked under short-term contracts as a character actor (often billed as 'Daniel O'Herlihy') for Universal and 20th Century Fox, typically cast in costume dramas like The Black Shield of Falworth (1954), The Purple Mask (1955) and The Virgin Queen (1955). When movie roles became scarce, he branched out into anthology television, eventually becoming a much sought-after guest star on popular prime time shows like The Untouchables (1959), Bonanza (1959) and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1964). Work on radio shows, like 'Johnny Dollar', 'Suspense' and 'Lux Radio Theatre', also continued to provide him with a steady source of income. From the mid-1960's, he was afforded several better film opportunities: first, in a memorable dual role as the sinister, voyeuristic Dr. Caligari, and the handsome psychiatrist treating repressed mental patient Jane Lindstrom (Glynis Johns), in Robert Bloch's off-beat psycho-thriller, The Cabinet of Caligari (1962). Secondly, giving an absolutely mesmerizing performance, as an anguished Air Force general contemplating orders to drop a hydrogen bomb over New York, in Sidney Lumet's gripping anti-war drama Fail-Safe (1964). He was also, among later big screen appearances, one of many name actors in the star-studded military epic Waterloo (1970) (as Napoleon's Marshal Ney); unrecognisable in make-up as a reptilian alien in the 'Star Wars' clone The Last Starfighter (1984); as irredeemable villains in Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) and RoboCop (1987); and as the inscrutable Andrew Packard in Twin Peaks (1990) on TV. O'Herlihy continued to alternate film work with acting on stage in Los Angeles and at the Abbey Theater. He died in February 2005 at the age of 85, leaving his papers to the care of the University College Dublin, from where he had obtained his degree in architecture way back in 1945.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNjYxOTEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA3NTUwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641397","name":"Dan O'Herlihy","idIMDB":"nm0641397","born":"May 1, 1919 in Wexford, Ireland","died":"February 17, 2005 (age 85) in Malibu, California, USA","starSign":"Taurus","starMeter":"47%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"The Rat Pack","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0146165"},{"title":"VR.5","year":" 1995","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0112209"},{"title":"Batman: The Animated Series","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0103359"},{"title":"Under the Hammer","year":" 1994","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0111554"},{"title":"Love, Cheat & Steal","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0107451"},{"title":"The Pirates of Dark Water","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0101169"},{"title":"Twin Peaks","year":" 1990-1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0098936"},{"title":"Father Dowling Mysteries","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096582"},{"title":"RoboCop 2","year":" 1990","remarks":["Old Man (as Daniel O'Herlihy)"],"imdbid":"tt0100502"},{"title":"The Equalizer","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088513"},{"title":"A Waltz Through the Hills","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0096412"},{"title":"The Ray Bradbury Theatre","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0088591"},{"title":"L.A.

Born in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, Cox received positive reviews in his first film role for his portrayal of ill-fated businessman Drew Ballinger in the terrifying backwoods thriller Deliverance (1972) with Cox featuring in the entertaining \"Duelling Banjos\" sequence of the film. Following this promising start, Cox was regularly guest-starring in numerous television series, before scoring the lead in the short-lived family drama Apple's Way (1974) and grabbing the critics attention again with an excellent performance in the Emmy nominated telemovie A Case of Rape (1974). Interestingly, Cox was often at his best playing rigorous authority figures usually in law enforcement or military roles including as a detective in the telemovie Who Is the Black Dahlia? (1975), alongside Charlton Heston in the submarine drama Gray Lady Down (1978), an Los Angeles detective pursuing cop killers in The Onion Field (1979), and alongside then-rising stars Tom Cruise and Sean Penn in the powerful Taps (1981). The 1980s was a high profile decade for Cox with strong supporting roles in several blockbusters playing strong-willed figures on both sides of the law. Cox starred alongside box office sensation Eddie Murphy in the mega-hit Beverly Hills Cop (1984) and its sequel Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), as well as portraying sinister company executives in the futuristic sci-fi action films RoboCop (1987) and Total Recall (1990). Throughout the 1990s, Cox was again prolific, appearing in many television series, feature films and high-caliber telemovies - He took control of the USS Enterprise for two episodes as Captain Edward Jellico in Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), and Cox contributed entertaining performances in Murder at 1600 (1997), Early Edition (1996), Forces of Nature (1999) and the chilling tale Perfect Murder, Perfect Town: JonBenét and the City of Boulder (2000). Cox has continued to remain busy with more recent performances in Stargate SG-1 (1997), Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) and the highly popular Desperate Housewives (2004). However, when he's not in front of the cameras, Cox can be found touring and demonstrating his musical talents at various music festivals and theatre shows and, to-date, he has released five CDs - an eclectic mixture of jazz, folk and western tunes.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMjAzNTI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA1MjcyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001074","name":"Ronny Cox","idIMDB":"nm0001074","born":"July 23, 1938 in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, USA","starSign":"Leo","starMeter":"88%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Demon Star","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt7649452"},{"title":"Nashville","year":" 2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2281375"},{"title":"Pure Country Pure Heart","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt6148766"},{"title":"Married","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2786956"},{"title":"True Detective","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2356777"},{"title":"Childrens Hospital","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1325113"},{"title":"Beyond the Reach","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2911668"},{"title":"Age of Dinosaurs","year":" 2013","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2518926"},{"title":"Leverage","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1103987"},{"title":"Mr. Sunshine","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1583638"},{"title":"Dexter","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0773262"},{"title":"Truth Be Told","year":" 2011","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1857929"},{"title":"Cockpit: The Rule of Engagement","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1512751"},{"title":"Imagine That","year":" 2009","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0780567"},{"title":"The Starter Wife","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1127107"},{"title":"Cold Case","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0368479"},{"title":"Tell Me You Love Me","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0809497"},{"title":"RoboCop: Villains of Old Detroit","year":" 2007","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt1478283"},{"title":"Commander in Chief","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0429455"},{"title":"Desperate Housewives","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0410975"},{"title":"Medium","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0412175"},{"title":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","year":" 2005","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0203259"},{"title":"The L.A.

(born John William Ford), an actor turned advertising executive. His father was of Irish and German ancestry, while his maternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Minsk, Belarus. Harrison was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (Ironside (1967), The Virginian (1962)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in American Graffiti (1973). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Four years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in Witness (1985). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in Patriot Games (1992). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in The Fugitive (1993). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope. On March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had suffered engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4Mjg0NjIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM2NTI3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148","name":"Harrison Ford","nicknames":["Harry"],"idIMDB":"nm0000148","born":"July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois, USA","starSign":"Cancer","starMeter":"55%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Untitled Indiana Jones Project","year":" 2021","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1462764"},{"title":"Call of the Wild","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt7504726"},{"title":"The Secret Life of Pets 2","year":" 2019","remarks":["(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5113040"},{"title":"Blade Runner 2049","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1856101"},{"title":"Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens","year":" 2016","remarks":["(Video Game)","Han Solo (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt5430544"},{"title":"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert","year":" 2015","remarks":["(TV Series)","Harrison Ford (segment \"Han Wars: Episode VII -

In 1988, Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Untouchables (1987). His film career also includes such films as Marnie (1964), The Name of the Rose (1986), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Highlander (1986), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), DragonHeart (1996) and The Rock (1996). Connery has been polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure\". In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was voted \"Sexiest Man of the Century\". Thomas Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland. His mother, Euphemia McBain (née McLean), was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He has a brother, Neil Connery, who works as a plasterer in Edinburgh. He is of Irish and Scottish descent. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional footballer or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent moves. No Road Back (1957) was Sean's first major movie role, and it followed by several Tv-movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) and guest appearances on TV-series, and also films such as Hell Drivers (1957), Another Time, Another Place (1958), Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959), The Frightened City (1961). In 1962 he appeared in The Longest Day (1962) with a host of other stars. Connery's breakthrough came in the role of secret agent James Bond. He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded his career would greatly benefit. He played the character in the first five Bond films: Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), and You Only Live Twice (1967) - then appeared again as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Never Say Never Again (1983). All seven films were commercially successful. James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. Connery's selection for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer \"Cubby\" Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading her husband that Connery was the right man. James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery's casting, saying, \"He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks\", and \"I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man,\" adding that Connery (muscular, 6' 2\", and a Scot) was unrefined. Fleming's girlfriend told him that Connery had the requisite sexual charisma, and Fleming changed his mind after the successful Dr. No (1962) premiere. He was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for Bond in the later novels. Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, related that, \"Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat.\" The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week, and the actor became one of the great male sex symbols of film. During the filming of Thunderball (1965), Connery's life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in Emilio Largo's pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, but, despite this, it was not a fixed structure and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately. Connery was forced to wear a toupee during each of the Bond movies because he had started balding at the age of 17. This didn't prevent Connery from being cast in roles, although it became more noticeable in his later years. In 2005, From Russia with Love was adapted by Electronic Arts into a video game, titled From Russia with Love (2005), which featured all-new voice work by Connery as well as his likeness, and those of several of the film's supporting cast. After and during the success of the Bond-films he has maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964), The Hill (1965), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), The Wind and the Lion (1975), Time Bandits (1981), Highlander (1986), The Name of the Rose (1986), The Untouchables (1987) (which earned him an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Rising Sun (1993), The Rock (1996), Finding Forrester (2000), and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003). Sean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had a son, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963, he followed in his father's footsteps and also became an actor. The marriage ended in divorce in 1973. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they have stayed married, they have no children together. He is also a grandfather. His son, Jason and his ex-wife, actress Mia Sara had a son, Dashiell Quinn Connery, in 1997.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcwNTM4MzctYjQzMi00NTA2LTljYWItNTYzNmE1MTYxN2RlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125","name":"Sean Connery","nicknames":["Big Tam"],"idIMDB":"nm0000125","born":"August 25, 1930 in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK","starSign":"Virgo","starMeter":"65%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Sir Billi","year":" 2012","remarks":["Sir Billi (voice, as Sir Sean Connery)"],"imdbid":"tt0851471"},{"title":"From Russia with Love","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Video Game)","James Bond (voice, as Sir Sean Connery)"],"imdbid":"tt0455566"},{"title":"Freedom: A History of Us","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0361185"},{"title":"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0311429"},{"title":"Finding Forrester","year":" 2000","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0181536"},{"title":"Entrapment","year":" 1999","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0137494"},{"title":"Playing by Heart","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0145734"},{"title":"The Avengers","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0118661"},{"title":"The Rock","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0117500"},{"title":"DragonHeart","year":" 1996","remarks":["Draco (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0116136"},{"title":"First Knight","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0113071"},{"title":"Just Cause","year":" 1995","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0113501"},{"title":"Un Anglais sous les tropiques","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0109920"},{"title":"Rising Sun","year":" 1993","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0107969"},{"title":"Medicine Man","year":" 1992","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0104839"},{"title":"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves","year":" 1991","remarks":["King Richard (uncredited)"],"imdbid":"tt0102798"},{"title":"Highlander II: The Quickening","year":" 1991","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0102034"},{"title":"The Russia House","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0100530"},{"title":"The Hunt for Red October","year":" 1990","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0099810"},{"title":"Family Business","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097328"},{"title":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097576"},{"title":"Memories of Me","year":" 1988","remarks":["Sean Connery as Lt.

born in Dublin in 1966, in a well-off family. She is the youngest of three children. She was educated in a convent, where she gained a passion for the arts. She later studied at the National College of Fine Arts in Dublin, but left because she lacked the motivation and thought she would take a year off to think it out. Meanwhile, while sitting in a café with friends, she was approached by a still photographer who asked her if she would be interested to model. Thinking she could use the pocket money, she said yes. Modeling proved to be both fun and lucrative, and very soon she did it professionally. Her modeling contracts led to commercial work, which would take her around the world. One day, a casting director saw her work and suggested she try acting instead. She was sent to London at age 19, where she quickly won an audition to appear in the new James Bond film, A View to a Kill (1985). She so loved acting that she pursued a career in that direction. After her first film, she shot a few TV dramas in London and in Dublin, but her big break came when she was cast as Aryan seductress Dr. Elsa Schneider in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Apparently she made a huge impression on Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who loved her great sense of humor and her Grace Kelly looks. After Indiana Jones, which introduced her to Hollywood and to the United States, she was chosen to replace Cybill Shepherd as spokeswoman for L'Oréal. After that she shot a few B-movies in the United States, but at one point felt she missed Ireland too much, so she went back to Dublin. In 1994, she put her career on hold to spend more time with media heir Gavin O'Reilly, whom she had been dating for two years. In 1996 they married, and later had two children. In 2002, she was asked to cameo in the 'Michael Caine (I)_ comedy The Actors (2003), and there she regained a lust for the movie industry. The following summer, she shot King Solomon's Mines (2004) with co-star Patrick Swayze, and it's then that the whole ball started rolling again. In 2005, she and her husband divorced and she decided to re-launch her stalled career, but she quickly realized how difficult it was to break into this kind of business for a second time, especially after ten years away from the camera. Recently she appeared in the short film Benjamin's Struggle (2005), directed by newcomer Jamie Breese, and played a role in the well-known British series Waking the Dead (2000). In a recent interview, she said she was thrilled to be acting again, but added that she wasn't willing to accept anything for the sake of working. She is determined to find the right part, but she also wants to do different things: \"I'm fed up playing the nasty Nazi. I'd like to do something quite extreme.\"","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NjI5MTExM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUxNDczMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0233145","name":"Alison Doody","idIMDB":"nm0233145","born":"November 11, 1966 in Dublin, Ireland","starSign":"Scorpio","starMeter":"62%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"We Still Die the Old Way","year":" 2018","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt5938666"},{"title":"The Rapture","year":" ","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1274646"},{"title":"The Rising Hawk","year":" 2019","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt7439064"},{"title":"Division 19","year":" 2017","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2492344"},{"title":"Brother","year":" 2016","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2903186"},{"title":"We Still Kill the Old Way","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3157224"},{"title":"Beaver Falls","year":" 2011-2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1919418"},{"title":"Billy & Chuck","year":" 2011","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt1798605"},{"title":"The Clinic","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0383087"},{"title":"Waking the Dead","year":" 2007","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0259733"},{"title":"Benjamin's Struggle","year":" 2005","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt0463906"},{"title":"King Solomon's Mines","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0397501"},{"title":"The Actors","year":" 2003","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0307919"},{"title":"Temptation","year":" 1994/I","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0111391"},{"title":"Major League II","year":" 1994","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0110442"},{"title":"Les nouveaux mousquetaires","year":" 1992","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0110992"},{"title":"Selling Hitler","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0124256"},{"title":"Duel of Hearts","year":" 1991","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0104149"},{"title":"Women in Tropical Places","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0309077"},{"title":"The Jim Henson Hour","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0096619"},{"title":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade","year":" 1989","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0097576"},{"title":"Echoes","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0213628"},{"title":"The Storyteller","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0092383"},{"title":"Taffin","year":" 1988","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0096211"},{"title":"Campaign","year":" 1988","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0094428"},{"title":"Harry's Kingdom","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0093150"},{"title":"Queenie","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0093808"},{"title":"The Secret Garden","year":" 1987","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0093935"},{"title":"A Prayer for the Dying","year":" 1987","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0093771"},{"title":"Howards' Way","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Series)","(1986-1987)"],"imdbid":"tt0134250"},{"title":"Deceptions","year":" 1985","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt0089008"},{"title":"A View to a Kill","year":" 1985","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0090264"}]},{"section":"Self","filmography":[{"title":"The 7th Annual Irish Film and Television Awards","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt1612583"},{"title":"The Late Late Show","year":" 2009","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0264270"},{"title":"Xposé","year":" 2008","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1016283"},{"title":"Indy's Women: The American Film Institute Tribute","year":" 2008","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt5296822"},{"title":"Hollywood Greats","year":" 2006","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0261475"},{"title":"Happy Birthday Oscar Wilde","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0440455"},{"title":"2nd Irish Film and Television Awards","year":" 2004","remarks":["(TV Special)"],"imdbid":"tt0432688"},{"title":"Irish Film and Television Awards","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0385784"},{"title":"Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Video documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0395656"},{"title":"Entertainment Tonight","year":" 2003","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0081857"},{"title":"Wogan","year":" 1989","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0083504"}]},{"section":"Archive footage","filmography":[{"title":"The Light and Magic of 'Indiana Jones'","year":" 2003","remarks":["(Video documentary short)"],"imdbid":"tt1193497"},{"title":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: A Look Inside","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Movie documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0330446"},{"title":"Intimate Portrait","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series documentary)"],"imdbid":"tt0896232"}]}]},{"birthName":"Tara Leigh Patrick","height":"5' 2½\" (1.59 m)","bio":"Carmen Electra was born Tara Leigh Patrick on April 20, 1972 in Sharonville, Ohio, to Patricia Rose (Kincade), a singer, and Harry Stanley Patrick, an entertainer and guitarist. She is of mostly English, German, and Irish descent. She grew up near Cincinnati, Ohio and got her first boost when a scout for Prince spotted her fronting for a rap group in Los Angeles, California. She released a self-titled album for Prince's Paisley Park label in 1993. She then toured Europe as Prince's opening act on his 1992 Diamonds and Pearls Tour. Carmen later returned to work for Prince at his Los Angeles nightclub \"Glam Slam\". She performed there every weekend with the Erotic City dancers, led by choreographer and director Jamie King. In March 1997, she appeared in cartoon form as the model for a character who is a singer and a vampire (\"but a good vampire\", says her publicist) in a comic book series called \"Embrace\". Carmen later went to co-star on the television series Baywatch (1989) as lifeguard Lani McKenzie, and as host of MTV's game show Singled Out (1995).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxODAzODM2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE5OTE2MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001182","name":"Carmen Electra","idIMDB":"nm0001182","born":"April 20, 1972 in Sharonville, Ohio, USA","starSign":"Taurus","starMeter":"50%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actress","filmography":[{"title":"Alone Together","year":" 2018","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt5615840"},{"title":"Jane the Virgin","year":" 2016","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt3566726"},{"title":"Book of Fire","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2825240"},{"title":"Chocolate City","year":" 2015","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt3481000"},{"title":"Lap Dance","year":" 2014","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt2392385"},{"title":"The Birthday Boys","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt2764636"},{"title":"Franklin & Bash","year":" 2014","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1600199"},{"title":"Dragula","year":" 2014","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3180228"},{"title":"Fra Sydhavn til West Coast","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)","Carmen Electra (2013)"],"imdbid":"tt3305014"},{"title":"Cum Ghosts","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3281156"},{"title":"The Food Truck with Carmen Electra","year":" 2013","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt3065004"},{"title":"Suburgatory","year":" 2013","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1741256"},{"title":"90210","year":" 2012","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1225901"},{"title":"The Axe Boat","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Short)"],"imdbid":"tt2413634"},{"title":"2-Headed Shark Attack","year":" 2012","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt2043757"},{"title":"Mardi Gras: Spring Break","year":" 2011","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt1083462"},{"title":"Back Nine","year":" 2010","remarks":["(TV Movie)"],"imdbid":"tt1604106"},{"title":"Filter: No Love","year":" 2010","remarks":["(Video short)"],"imdbid":"tt4040510"},{"title":"Barry Munday","year":" 2010","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0482461"},{"title":"Oy Vey!

imitating accents, actor Tim Roth was born Timothy Simon Roth on May 14, 1961 in Lambeth, London, England. His mother, Ann, was a teacher and landscape painter. His father, Ernie, was a journalist who had changed the family name from \"Smith\" to \"Roth\"; Ernie was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an immigrant family of Irish ancestry. Tim grew up in Dulwich, a middle-class area in the south of London. He demonstrated his talent for picking up accents at an early age when he attended school in Brixton, where he faced persecution from classmates for his comfortable background and quickly perfected a cockney accent to blend in. He attended Camberwell Art College and studied sculpture before he dropped out and pursued acting. The blonde actor's first big break was the British TV movie Made in Britain (1982). Roth made a huge splash in that film as a young skinhead named Trevor. He next worked with director Mike Leigh on Meantime (1983), which he has counted among his favorite projects. He debuted on the big screen when he filled in for Joe Strummer in the Stephen Frears neo-noir The Hit (1984). Roth gained more attention for his turn as Vincent Van Gogh in Vincent et Théo (1990) and his work opposite Gary Oldman in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990). He moved to Los Angeles in search of work and caught the eye of young director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino had envisioned Roth as a possible Mr. Blonde or Mr. Pink in his heist flick Reservoir Dogs (1992), but Roth campaigned for the role of Mr. Orange instead, and ultimately won the part. It proved to be a huge breakthrough for Roth, as audiences found it difficult to forget his performance as a member of a group of jewelry store robbers who is slowly bleeding to death. Tarantino cast Roth again in the landmark film Pulp Fiction (1994). Roth and actress Amanda Plummer played a pair of robbers who hold up a restaurant. 1995 saw the third of Roth's collaborations with Tarantino, a surprisingly slapstick performance in the anthology film Four Rooms (1995). That same year Roth picked up an Academy Award nomination for his campy turn as a villain in the period piece Rob Roy (1995). Continuing to take on disparate roles, Roth did his own singing (with an American accent to boot) in the lightweight Woody Allen musical Everyone Says I Love You (1996). He starred opposite Tupac Shakur in Shakur's last film, the twisted comedy Gridlock'd (1997). The pair received positive critical notices for their comic chemistry. Standing in contrast to the criminals and baddies that crowd his CV, Roth's work as the innocent, seafaring pianist in the Giuseppe Tornatore film La légende du pianiste sur l'océan (1998) became something of a fan favorite. Grittier fare followed when Roth made his directorial debut with The War Zone (1999), a frank, critically acclaimed drama about a family torn apart by incest. He made his next high-profile appearance as an actor as General Thade, an evil simian in the Tim Burton remake of Planet of the Apes (2001). Roth was, of course, all but unrecognizable in his primate make-up. Roth has continued to enjoy a mix of art house and mainstream work, including everything from the lead role in Francis Ford Coppola's esoteric Youth Without Youth (2007) to becoming \"The Abomination\" in the special effects-heavy blockbuster The Incredible Hulk (2008). Roth took his first major American television role when he signed on to the Fox-TV series Lie to Me (2009)","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NTA3MDQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM4NDE3Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000619","name":"Tim

Travolta. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry. His father owned a tire repair shop called Travolta Tires in Hillsdale, NJ. Travolta started acting appearing in a local production of \"Who'll Save the Plowboy?\". His mother, herself an actress and dancer, enrolled him in a drama school in New York, where he studied voice, dancing and acting. He decided to combine all three of these skills and become a musical comedy performer. At 16 he landed his first professional job in a summer stock production of the musical \"Bye Bye Birdie\". He quit school at 16 and moved to New York, and worked regularly in summer stock and on television commercials. When work became scarce in New York, he went to Hollywood and appeared in minor roles in several series. A role in the national touring company of the hit 1950s musical \"Grease\" brought him back to New York. An opening in the New York production of \"Grease\" gave him his first Broadway role at age 18. After \"Grease\", he became a member of the company of the Broadway show \"Over Here\", which starred The Andrews Sisters. After ten months in \"Over Here\", he decided to try Hollywood once again. Once back in Hollywood, he had little trouble getting roles in numerous television shows. He was seen on The Rookies (1972), Emergency! (1972) and Medical Center (1969) and also made a movie, The Devil's Rain (1975), which was shot in New Mexico. The day he returned to Hollywood from New Mexico, he was called to an audition for a new situation comedy series ABC was planning to produce called Welcome Back, Kotter (1975). He got the part of Vinnie Barbarino and the series went on the air during the 1975 fall season. He starred in a number of monumental films, earning his first Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for his role in the blockbuster Saturday Night Fever (1977), which launched the disco phenomenon in the 1970s. He went on to star in the big-screen version of the long-running musical Grease (1978) and the wildly successful Urban Cowboy (1980), which also influenced trends in popular culture. Additional film credits include the Brian De Palma thrillers Carrie (1976) and Blow Out (1981), as well as Amy Heckerling's hit comedy Look Who's Talking (1989) and Nora Ephron's comic hit Michael (1996). Travolta starred in Phenomenon (1996) and took an equally distinctive turn as an action star in John Woo's top-grossing Broken Arrow (1996). He also starred in the classic Face/Off (1997) opposite Nicolas Cage, and The General's Daughter (1999), co-starring Madeleine Stowe. In 2005, Travolta reprised the role of ultra cool Chili Palmer in the Get Shorty (1995) sequel Be Cool (2005). In addition, he starred opposite Scarlett Johansson in the critically-acclaimed independent feature film A Love Song for Bobby Long (2004), which was screened at the Venice Film Festival, where both Travolta and the films won rave reviews. In February 2011, John was honored by Europe's leading weekly program magazine HORZU, with the prestigious Golden Camera Award for \"Best Actor International\" in Berlin, Germany. Other recent feature film credits include box-office hit-comedy \"Wild Hogs\", the action-thriller Ladder 49 (2004), the movie version of the successful comic book The Punisher (2004), the drama Basic (2003), the psychological thriller Domestic Disturbance (2001), the hit action picture Swordfish (2001), the infamous sci-fi movie Battlefield Earth (2000), based upon the best-selling novel by L. Ron Hubbard, and Coeurs perdus (2006). Travolta has been honored twice with Academy Award nominations, the latest for his riveting portrayal of a philosophical hit-man in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994). He also received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for this highly-acclaimed role and was named Best Actor by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, among other distinguished awards. Travolta garnered further praise as a Mafioso-turned-movie producer in the comedy sensation Get Shorty (1995), winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy. In 1998, Travolta was honored by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts with the Britanna Award: and in that same year he received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Chicago Film Festival. Travolta also won the prestigious Alan J. Pakula Award from the US Broadcast Critics Association for his performance in A Civil Action (1998), based on the best-selling book and directed by Steven Zaillian. He was nominated again for a Golden Globe for his performance in Primary Colors (1998), directed by Mike Nichols and co-starring Emma Thompson and Billy Bob Thornton, and in 2008, he received his sixth Golden Globe nomination for his role as \"Edna Turnblad\" in the big-screen, box-office hit, Hairspray (2007). As a result of this performance, the Chicago Film Critics and the Santa Barbara Film Festival decided to recognize Travolta with a Lifetime Achievement Award for his role. In addition, Travolta starred opposite Denzel Washington in Tony Scott's remake The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009), and he provided the voice of the lead character in Walt Disney Pictures' animated hit Bolt (2008), which was nominated for a 2009 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film and a Golden Globe for Best Animated Film, in addition to Best Song for John and Miley Cyrus' duet titled, \"I Thought I Lost You\". Next, Travolta starred in Walt Disney Pictures' Old Dogs (2009), along with Robin Williams, Kelly Preston and Ella Bleu Travolta, followed by the action thriller From Paris with Love (2010), starring opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers. In 2012, John starred alongside Taylor Kitsch, Blake Lively, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Benicio Del Toro, Salma Hayek, Emile Hirsch and Demián Bichir in Oliver Stone's, Savages (2012). The film was based on Don Winslow's best-selling crime novel that was named one of The New York Times' Top 10 Books of 2010. John was most recently seen in Killing Season (2013), co-starring Robert De Niro, and directed by Mark Steven Johnson. John recently completed production on the Boston-based film, The Forger (2014), alongside Academy Award winner Christopher Plummer and Critic's Choice nominee Tye Sheridan. John plays a second-generation petty thief who arranges to get out of prison to spend time with his ailing son (Sheridan) by taking on a job with his father (Plummer) to pay back the syndicate that arranged his release. John has received 2 prestigious aviation awards: in 2003, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Foundation Award for Excellence for his efforts to promote commercial flying, and, in 2007, The Living Legends Ambassador of Aviation award. John holds 11 jet licenses: 747, 707, Gulfstream II, Lear 24, Hawker 1251A, Eclipse Jet, Vampire Jet, Canadair CL-141 Jet, Soko Jet, Citation ISP and Challenger. Travolta is the Qantas Airways Global Goodwill \"Ambassador-at-Large\" and piloted the original Qantas 707 during \"Spirit of Friendship\" global tour in July/August 2002. John is also a business aircraft brand ambassador for Learjet, Challenger and Global jets for the world's leading business aircraft manufacturer, Bombardier. John flew the 707 to New Orleans after the 2005 hurricane disaster bringing food and medical supplies, and in 2010, again flew the 707, this time to Haiti after the earthquake, carrying supplies, doctors and volunteers. John, along with his wife, actress Kelly Preston, are also very involved in their charity, The Jett Travolta Foundation, which raises money for children with educational needs.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNjQ0ODkxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc5NjQwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000237","name":"John

Dern","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Laura Dern was born on February 10, 1967 in Los Angeles, the daughter of actors Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd. Dern was exposed to movie sets and the movie industry from infancy, and obtained several bit parts as a child. Her parents divorced when Dern was two and Dern lost contact with her father for several years as a result. Her parents' background and her own early taste of the moviemaking world soon convinced the young Dern to pursue acting herself. Like so many young actors, her decision may have been influenced by social awkwardness -- the child of 60s counterculture parents, she was steeped in Eastern mysticism and political radicalism, and was seen as an oddball by her more conservative classmates. Her gawky physical appearance didn't help - even before her teens, she had achieved most of her impressive 5' 10\" height, was rail-skinny (other than precociously wide hips), had huge feet and a slouching posture, and for all this was often teased by classmates. Perhaps the nine-year-old Dern found refuge by studying acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute. The first success for the young Dern came in 1980, with a role in Adrian Lyne's Foxes (1980), a teen movie starring Jodie Foster. She followed this with several small parts, or parts in small movies, such as Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982) and Teachers (1984), as a student who has an affair with a teacher. (Her mother objected to her active presence on movie sets at age thirteen, which required Dern to sue for emancipation so she could play her role in \"The Fabulous Stains\"). Her next roles, as the blind girl who befriends the deformed boy in Mask (1985), and as a teenaged girl whose sexual awakening collides with a mysterious older man in Smooth Talk (1985), gave her career an important boost. Dern appeared to have made it with a leading role in David Lynch's acclaimed Blue Velvet (1986), but it was four years before her next notable film, and this was the bizarre Wild at Heart (1990), also directed by Lynch. The following year, Dern starred in Rambling Rose (1991), which would become her signature performance, as a sexually-precocious, free-spirited young housemaid in the South in the 1930s. Dern earned an Oscar nomination for her performance, and so did her mother and co-star, Diane Ladd. Dern continues to win prominent roles on the big screen, often in smaller, highly-regarded human dramas such as October Sky (1999), I Am Sam (2001) and We Don't Live Here Anymore (2004), although she is perhaps most widely known for her repeat role as Ellie Sattler in the summer adventure movies Jurassic Park (1993) and Jurassic Park III (2001), or for her guest performance on Ellen (1994), as the woman to whom Ellen finally comes out as a lesbian. Dern's pre-teen gawkiness matured into lithe beauty, but this doesn't prevent Dern from fearlessly throwing herself into a wide variety of roles which are sometimes unflattering, an excellent example being her unflinchingly comic portrayal of an intensely annoying loser whose pregnancy becomes a social and political football in Citizen Ruth (1996). This results in Dern being one of the most interesting actors working in Hollywood today. Having previously dated such Hollywood talent as Treat Williams, Renny Harlin, Kyle MacLachlan, Jeff Goldblum and Billy Bob Thornton, Dern eventually married musician Ben Harper in 2005. Early in her career, Dern was roommate to Marianne Williamson, the spirituality guru. Dern attended two days of college at UCLA and one semester at USC.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NzY0MDQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMzcyNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000368","name":"Laura

Goldblum, a doctor. His father was of Russian Jewish descent and his mother was of Austrian Jewish ancestry. Goldblum began his career on the New York stage after moving to the city at age seventeen. Possessing his own unique style of delivery, Goldblum made an impression on moviegoers with little more than a single line in Woody Allen's Annie Hall (1977), when he fretted about having forgotten his mantra. Goldblum went on to appear in the remake Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and co-starred with Ben Vereen in the detective series Tenspeed and Brown Shoe (1980) before a high-profile turn in the classic ensemble film The Big Chill (1983). The quirky actor turned up in the suitably quirky film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984), which became a 1980s cult classic, starred in the modern-day film noir Into the Night (1985), then went on to a breakthrough role in the David Cronenberg remake The Fly (1986), which also featured actress Geena Davis, Goldblum's wife from 1987-1990 and co-star in two additional films: Transylvania 6-5000 (1985) and Julien Temple's Earth Girls Are Easy (1988). Goldblum was the rather unlikely star of some of the biggest blockbusters of the 1990s: Steven Spielberg's dinosaur adventure Jurassic Park (1993) and its sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), as well as the alien invasion film Independence Day (1996). These films saw Goldblum playing the type of intellectual characters he has become associated with. More recently, roles have included critically acclaimed turns in Igby Goes Down (2002) and Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004). In 2009, he returned to television to star in his second crime series Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001).","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5NzkyODg1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTY2OTE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000156","name":"Jeff

Attenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). His film career began with a role as a deserting sailor in In Which We Serve (1942), a part that contributed to his being typecast for many years as a coward in films like Dulcimer Street (1948), Operation Disaster (1950) and his breakthrough role as a psychopathic young gangster in the film adaptation of Graham Greene's novel, Brighton Rock (1948). During World War II, Attenborough served in the Royal Air Force. He worked prolifically in British films for the next 30 years, and in the 1950s appeared in several successful comedies for John Boulting and Roy Boulting, including Private's Progress (1956) and I'm All Right Jack (1959). Early in his stage career, Attenborough starred in the London West End production of Agatha Christie's \"The Mousetrap\", which went on to become one of the world's longest-running stage productions. Both he and his wife were among the original cast members of the production, which opened in 1952 and (as of 2007) is still running. In the 1960s, he expanded his range of character roles in films such as Seance on a Wet Afternoon (1964) and Guns at Batasi (1964), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the regimental Sergeant Major. He appeared in the ensemble cast of The Great Escape (1963), as Squadron Leader \"Roger Bartlett\" (\"Big X\"), the head of the escape committee. In 1967 and 1968, he won back-to-back Golden Globe Awards in the category of Best Supporting Actor, the first time for The Sand Pebbles (1966), starring Steve McQueen, and the second time for Doctor Dolittle (1967), starring Rex Harrison. He would win another Golden Globe for Best Director, for Gandhi (1982), in 1983. Six years prior to \"Gandhi\", he played the ruthless \"Gen. Outram\" in Indian director Satyajit Ray's period piece, Les joueurs d'échecs (1977). He has never been nominated for an Academy Award in an acting category. He took no acting roles following his appearance in Otto Preminger's The Human Factor (1979), until his appearance as the eccentric developer \"John Hammond\" in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993). The following year, he starred as \"Kris Kringle\" in Miracle on 34th Street (1994), a remake of the 1947 classic. Since then, he has made occasional appearances in supporting roles, including the historical drama, Elizabeth (1998), as \"Sir William Cecil\". In the late 1950s, Attenborough formed a production company, \"Beaver Films\", with Bryan Forbes and began to build a profile as a producer on projects, including The League of Gentlemen (1960), The Angry Silence (1960) and Whistle Down the Wind (1961), also appearing in the first two of these as an actor. His feature film directorial debut was the all-star screen version of the hit musical, Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), and his acting appearances became more sporadic - the most notable being his portrayal of serial killer \"John Christie\" in 10 Rillington Place (1971). He later directed two epic period films: Young Winston (1972), based on the early life of Winston Churchill, and A Bridge Too Far (1977), an all-star account of Operation Market Garden in World War II. He won the 1982 Academy Award for Directing for his historical epic, Gandhi (1982), a project he had been attempting to get made for many years. As the film's producer, he also won the Academy Award for Best Picture. His most recent films, as director and producer, include Chaplin (1992), starring Robert Downey Jr. as Charles Chaplin, and Shadowlands (1993), based on the relationship between C.S. Lewis and Joy Gresham. Both films starred Anthony Hopkins, who also appeared in three other films for Attenborough: \"Young Winston\", \"A Bridge Too Far\" and the thriller, Magic (1978). Attenborough also directed the screen version of the hit Broadway musical, \"A Chorus Line\" (A Chorus Line (1985)), and the apartheid drama, Cry Freedom (1987), based on the experiences of Donald Woods. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Director for both films. His most recent film as director was another biographical film, Grey Owl (1999), starring Pierce Brosnan. Attenborough is the President of RADA, Chairman of Capital Radio, President of BAFTA, President of the Gandhi Foundation, and President of the British National Film and Television School. He is also a vice patron of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund. He is also the patron of the UWC movement (United World Colleges), whereby he continually contributes greatly to the colleges that are part of the organization. He has frequented the United World College of Southern Africa(UWCSA) Waterford Kamhlaba. His wife and he founded the \"Richard and Sheila Attenborough Visual Arts Center\". He also founded the \"Jane Holland Creative Center for Learning\" at Waterford Kamhlaba in Swaziland in memory of his daughter, who died in the Tsunami on Boxing Day, 2004. He passionately believes in education, primarily education that does not judge upon color, race, creed or religion. His attachment to Waterford is his passion for non-racial education, which were the grounds on which Waterford Kamhlaba was founded. Waterford was one of his inspirations for directing Cry Freedom (1987), based on the life of Steve Biko. He was elected to the post of Chancellor of the University of Sussex on 20 March 1998, replacing the Duke of Richmond and Gordon. A lifelong supporter of Chelsea Football Club, Attenborough served as a director of the club from 1969-1982 and, since 1993, has held the honorary position of Life Vice President. He is also the head of the consortium, \"Dragon International\", which is constructing a film and television studio complex in Llanilid, Wales, often referred to as \"Valleywood\". In 1967, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He was knighted in 1976 and, in 1993, he was made a life peer as Baron Attenborough, of Richmond-upon-Thames in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. On 13 July 2006, Attenborough and his brother, David Attenborough, were awarded the titles of Distinguished Honorary Fellows of the University of Leicester \"in recognition of a record of continuing distinguished service to the University\". Lord Attenborough is also listed as an Honorary Fellow of Bangor University for his continued efforts to film making. Attenborough has been married to English actress Sheila Sim, since 1945. They had three children. In December 2004, his elder daughter, Jane Holland, as well as her daughter Lucy and her mother-in-law, also named Jane, were killed in the tsunami caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake. A memorial service was held on 8 March 2005, and Attenborough read a lesson at the national memorial service on 11 May 2005. His grandson, Samuel Holland, and granddaughter, Alice Holland, also read in the service. Attenborough's father was principal of University College, Leicester, now the city's university. This has resulted in a long association with the university, with Lord Attenborough a patron. A commemorative plaque was placed on the floor of Richmond Parish Church. The university's \"Richard Attenborough Centre for Disability and the Arts\", which opened in 1997, is named in his Honor. His son, Michael Attenborough, is also a director. He has two younger brothers, the famous naturalist Sir David Attenborough and John Attenborough, who has made a career in the motor trade. He has collected Pablo Picasso ceramics since the 1950s. More than 100 items went on display at the New Walk Museum and Art Gallery in Leicester in 2007; the exhibition is dedicated to his family members lost in the tsunami.","urlPhoto":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMDQzMTAwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI4NTgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000277","name":"Richard Attenborough","nicknames":["Dickie, Bunter."],"idIMDB":"nm0000277","born":"August 29, 1923 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England, UK","died":"August 24, 2014 (age 90) in Denville Hall, Northwood, Hillingdon, London, England, UK","starSign":"Virgo","starMeter":"56%","filmographies":[{"section":"Actor","filmography":[{"title":"Puckoon","year":" 2002","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0276428"},{"title":"Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story","year":" 2001","remarks":["(TV Mini-Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0264262"},{"title":"Masterpiece Classic","year":" 2000","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt0066684"},{"title":"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat","year":" 1999","remarks":["(Video)"],"imdbid":"tt0175790"},{"title":"It's Itsy Bitsy Time","year":" 1999","remarks":["(TV Series)"],"imdbid":"tt1601977"},{"title":"Jurassic Park: Trespasser","year":" 1998","remarks":["(Video Game)","John Hammond (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0304846"},{"title":"Elizabeth","year":" 1998","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0127536"},{"title":"Tom and Vicky","year":" 1998","remarks":["(TV Series)","(voice)"],"imdbid":"tt0339973"},{"title":"Jurassic Park: Chaos Island","year":" 1997","remarks":["(Video Game)","John Hammond (voice)"],"imdbid":"tt1306984"},{"title":"The Lost World: Jurassic Park","year":" 1997","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0119567"},{"title":"Hamlet","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116477"},{"title":"E=mc2","year":" 1996","remarks":null,"imdbid":"tt0116160"},{"title":"Jurassic Park: The Ride -
